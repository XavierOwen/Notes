    "# Security markets\n",
    "## How firms issue securities\n",
    "They can raise funds either by borrowing money or by selling shares in the firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary market**: Market for new issues of securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondary market**: Market for already-existing securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shares of *publicly listed* firms trade continually on well-known markets such as the New York Stock Exchange, also called *publicly traded*, *publicly owned*, or just *public companies*.There any investor can choose to buy shares for his or her portfolio. While *private corporations*, are whose shares are held by small numbers of managers and investors. The ownership stakes in the firm are still determined in proportion to share ownership, but those shares do not trade in public exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Privately Held Firms\n",
    "A privately held company is owned by a *relatively small number of shareholders*. Privately held firms have fewer obligations to release financial statements and other information to the public. This saves money and frees the firm from disclosing information that might be helpful to its competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Private placement**: Primary offerings in which shares are sold directly to a small group of institutional or wealthy investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "When private firms wish to raise funds, they sell shares directly to a small number of institutional or wealthy investors in a private placement. \n",
    "- Attractiveness  \n",
    "**Rule 144A of the SEC** allows them to make these placements without preparing the extensive and costly registration statements required of a public company. \n",
    "- Drawback  \n",
    "  1. Shares in privately held firms **do not trade in secondary markets** such as a stock exchange, and this greatly reduces their **liquidity** and presumably reduces the prices that investors will pay for them.  \n",
    "  *Liquidity refers to the ability to trade an asset at a fair price on short notice. Investors demand price concessions to buy illiquid securities.*\n",
    "  2. Privately held firms were allowed to have only up to 499 shareholders. This limited their ability to raise large amounts of capital from a wide base of investors.  \n",
    "  *Actually, almost all of the largest companies in the U.S. have been public corporations.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Publicly Traded Companies\n",
    "Firms can *go public* if they wish to raise capital from a wide range of investors. They will sell its securities to the general public and allow them to freely trade in established securities markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**initial public offering (IPO)**: First public sale of stock by a formerly private company.  \n",
    "Later, the firm may go back to the public and issue additional shares. A seasoned equity offering is the sale of additional shares in firms that already are publicly traded. For example, a sale by Apple of new shares of stock would be considered a seasoned new issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasoned equity offering**: the sale of additional shares in firms that already are publicly traded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**underwriters**: Underwriters purchase securities from the issuing company and resell them to the public.  \n",
    "Usually a lead firm forms an underwriting syndicate of other investment bankers to share the responsibility for the stock issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**prospectus**: A description of the firm and the security it is issuing.  \n",
    "A preliminary registration statement must be filed with the *Securities and Exchange Commission* (SEC), describing the issue and the prospects of the company. And prospectus is its final version. And at this point, the price at which the securities will be offered to the public is announced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Firm commitment**: The investment bankers purchase the securities from the issuing company and then resell them to the public. The issuing firm sells the securities to the underwriting syndicate for the public offering price **less a spread** that serves as compensation to the underwriters.  \n",
    "In addition to the spread, the investment banker also may receive shares of common stock or other securities of the firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shelf Registration\n",
    "In **1982** when the SEC approved **Rule 415**, which allows firms to register securities and gradually sell them to the public for two years following the initial registration.\n",
    "1. They can be sold on short notice, with little additional paperwork, because they are already registered.\n",
    "2. They can be sold in small amounts without incurring substantial flotation costs.\n",
    "3. The securities are “on the shelf,” *ready to be issued*.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Check**  \n",
    ">Why does it make sense for shelf registration to be limited in time?\n",
    ">\n",
    "Limited-time shelf registration was introduced because of its favorable trade-off of saving issue costs versus providing disclosure. Allowing unlimited shelf registration would circumvent “blue sky” laws that ensure proper disclosure as the financial circumstances of the firm change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Public Offering (IPO)\n",
    "Investment bankers manage the issuance of new securities to the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SEC commented on the registration statement and a preliminary prospectus then was distributed to interested investors\n",
    "2. the investment bankers organize ***road shows*** in which they travel around the country to publicize the imminent offering. The $purpose$ are:  \n",
    "  - generate interest among potential investors and provide information about the offering.\n",
    "  - provide information to the issuing firm and its underwriters about the price at which they will be able to market the securities.\n",
    "3. Large investors communicate their interest in purchasing shares of the IPO to the underwriters; these indications of interest are called a ***book*** and the process of polling potential investors is called ***bookbuilding***.  \n",
    "*The book provides valuable information to the issuing firm because institutional investors often will have useful insights about both the market demand for the security as well as the prospects of the firm and its competitors.*\n",
    "4. Investment bankers will commonly revise both their initial estimates of the offering price of a security and the number of shares offered based on feedback from the investing community.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dagger$  \n",
    "Other than leader underwriter, the investment bankers are also underwriters.\n",
    "\n",
    "IPOs commonly are **underpriced** compared to the price at which they could be marketed.\n",
    "1. If a firm wishes to get a large allocation when it is optimistic about the security, it needs to reveal its optimism.\n",
    "2. The underwriter needs to offer the security at a bargain price to these investors to induce them to participate in bookbuilding and share their information.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\odot$\n",
    "Despite their typically attractive first-day returns, IPOs have been poor long-term investments. Other IPOs cannot even be fully sold to the market. Underwriters left with unmarketable securities are forced to sell them at a loss on the secondary market. Therefore, the investment banker bears the price risk of an underwritten issue.$\\square$\n",

    "## How securities are traded\n",
    "### Types of Markets\n",
    "- Direct search markets\n",
    "   1. the least organized market.\n",
    "   2. Buyers and sellers must seek each other out directly.\n",
    "   3. sporadic participation and nonstandard goods.\n",
    "   >**e.g.**  \n",
    "   >sale of a used refrigerator on Craigslist\n",
    "- Brokered markets\n",
    "  1. The next level of organization\n",
    "  2. In markets where trading in a good is active, brokers find it profitable to offer search services to buyers and sellers.\n",
    "  3. Brokers in particular markets develop specialized knowledge on valuing assets traded in that market.\n",
    "  >**e.g.**  \n",
    "  >1. Real estate market, where economies of scale in searches for available homes and for prospective buyers make it worthwhile for participants to pay brokers to conduct the searches.\n",
    "  >2. Primary market, where new issues of securities are offered to the public, is an example of a brokered market.\n",
    "- **Dealer markets**: in which traders specializing in particular assets buy and sell for their own accounts.  \n",
    "  1. When trading activity in a particular type of asset increases, this market arise and get more organized.\n",
    "  2. Dealers purchase these assets for their own accounts, and later sell them for a profit from their inventory.\n",
    "  3. The spreads between dealers’ buy (or “bid”) prices and sell (or “ask”) prices are a source of profit.\n",
    "  4. Dealer markets save traders on search costs because market participants can easily look up the prices at which they can buy from or sell to dealers.\n",
    "  5. A fair amount of market activity is required\n",
    "  6. Most bonds trade in over-the-counter dealer markets.\n",
    "- **Auction markets**: A market where all traders meet at one place to buy or sell an asset.\n",
    "  1. An advantage of auction markets over dealer markets is that one need not search across dealers to find the best price for a good. If all participants converge, they can arrive at mutually agreeable prices and save the bid–ask spread.\n",
    "  2. Both over-the-counter dealer markets and stock exchanges are *secondary markets*. They are organized for investors to trade existing securities among themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\odot$\n",
    "More and more organized, and Brokered Market is primary market; Dealer Market and Auction Market are secondary market.$\\square$\n",
    "\n",
    ">**e.g.**\n",
    ">1. *NASDAQ*: Computer-linked priced quotation system for the OTC market. **A Dealer market**.\n",
    ">2. *NYSE*: Investors → Brokerage Firms → Floor broker → Specialist. **Auction market**\n",
    ">3. *Electronic Communication Network*: Computer networks that allow direct trading without market makers. **Direct Search market**\n",
    "\n",
    ">**e.g.**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">1. Used cars trade in dealer markets (used-car lots or auto dealerships) and in direct search markets when individuals advertise in local newspapers or on websites.\n",
    ">2. Paintings trade in broker markets when clients commission brokers to buy or sell art for them, in dealer markets at art galleries, and in auction markets.\n",
    "3. Rare coins trade in dealer markets, for example, in coin shops or shows, but they also trade in auctions and in direct search markets when individuals advertise they want to buy or sell coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Orders\n",
    "Broadly speaking, there are two types of orders: market orders and orders contingent on price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Market orders**: buy or sell orders that are to be executed immediately at current market prices.\n",
    "  1. **Bid Price**: The price at which a dealer or other trader is willing to purchase a security.\n",
    "  2. **Ask Price**: The price at which a dealer or other trader will sell a security.\n",
    "  3. **Bid-Ask Spread**: The difference between the bid and asked prices.\n",
    "  >**e.g.**\n",
    "  >Investor might call her broker and ask for the market price of Facebook. The broker might report back that the best bid price is \\$76.40 and the best ask price is \\$76.42, meaning that the investor would need to pay \\$76.42 to purchase a share and could receive \\$76.40 a share if she wished to sell some of her own holdings of Facebook.\n",
    "  4. posted price quotes actually represent commitments to trade up to a specified number of shares. If the market order is for more than this number of shares, the order may be filled at multiple prices. And we call **Depth** as the the total number of shares offered for trading at the best bid and ask prices.  \n",
    "  $\\dagger$  \n",
    "  If you want to purchase more than the dealer offered, the excess number of shares will be charged higher than the asked price.  \n",
    "  $\\odot$\n",
    "  Depth is considered another component of liquidity.$\\square$\n",
    "  5. Another trader may beat our investor to the quote, meaning that her order would then be executed at a worse price.  \n",
    "  $\\dagger$  \n",
    "  Beat means her offer a higher price to do the trade and then, your willing to buy, is lost.\n",
    "- Price-contingent orders\n",
    "  - **Limit buy (sell) order**: An order specifying a price at which an investor is willing to buy or sell a security.  \n",
    "  $\\odot$  \n",
    "    1. Limit buy order: instruct the broker to buy some number of shares if and when they may be obtained **at** or **below** a stipulated price.\n",
    "    2. Limit sell order: instruct the broker to sell if and when the stock price rises **above** a specified limit.  \n",
    "  $\\dagger$  \n",
    "  Actually, **at** that *limit price* is also OK.\n",
    "  - *Limit order book*: A collection of limit orders waiting to be executed.   \n",

    "2. Sell it and deposit proceeds and a margin in an account\n",
    "3. Closing out the position: buy the stock and return to the party who lent you the stock\n",
    "\n",

    "2. Before 1971, all OTC quotations were recorded *manually* and published daily on so-called *pink sheets*.\n",
    "3. In 1971, the *National Association of Securities Dealers introduced its Automatic Quotations System*, to link brokers and dealers in a computer network where price quotes could be displayed and revised. That is **NASDAQ**, the original NASDAQ\n",
    "4. NASDAQ was more of a price quotation system than a trading system after development. While dealers still post bid and ask prices over the network, what is now called the ***NASDAQ Stock Market***: The computer-linked price quotation and trade execution system, which allows for electronic execution of trades at quoted prices without the need for direct negotiation, and the vast majority of trades are executed electronically.\n",

While each security is assigned to only one specialist, each specialist firm makes a market in many securities.  \n",
    "**specialist**: A trader who makes a market in the shares of one or more firms and who maintains a “fair and orderly market” by dealing personally in the market.\n",
    "2. The specialist maintains the limit order book of all outstanding unexecuted limit orders. When orders can be executed at market prices, the specialist executes or “crosses” the trade. The highest outstanding bid price and the lowest outstanding ask price “win” the trade.\n",
    "3. Specialists are also mandated to maintain a “fair and orderly” market when the book of limit buy and sell orders is so thin that the spread between the highest bid price and lowest ask price becomes *too wide*. In this case, the specialist firm would be expected to offer to buy and sell shares from its own inventory at a *narrower* bid–ask spread. In this role, the specialist serves as a dealer in the stock and provides liquidity to other traders.   \n",

    "## The Rise of Electronic Trading\n",
    "1. New regulations allowed brokers to compete for business, broke the hold that dealers once had on information about best-available bid and ask prices, forced integration of markets, and allowed securities to trade in ever-smaller price increments (called tick sizes).\n",
    "2. just stop here\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "1. Firms issue securities to raise the capital necessary to finance their investments. Investment bankers market these securities to the public on the primary market. Investment bankers generally act as underwriters who purchase the securities from the firm and resell them to the public at a markup. Before the securities may be sold to the public, the firm must publish an SEC-approved prospectus that provides information on the firm’s prospects.\n",
    "2. Already-issued securities are traded on the secondary market, that is, in organized stock markets, or, primarily for bonds, on the over-the-counter market. Brokerage firms holding licenses to trade on an exchange sell their services to individuals, charging commissions for executing trades on their behalf.\n",
    "3. Trading may take place in dealer markets, via electronic communication networks, or in specialist markets. In dealer markets, security dealers post bid and ask prices at which they are willing to trade. Brokers for individuals execute trades at the best available prices. In electronic markets, the existing book of limit orders provides the terms at which trades can be executed. Mutually agreeable offers to buy or sell securities are automatically crossed by the computer system operating the market. In specialist markets, the specialist acts to maintain an orderly market with price continuity. Specialists maintain a limit order book but also sell from or buy for their own inventories of stock.\n",
    "4. NASDAQ was traditionally a dealer market in which a network of dealers negotiated directly over sales of securities. The NYSE was traditionally a specialist market. In recent years, however, both exchanges dramatically increased their commitment to electronic and automated trading. The overwhelming majority of trades today are electronic.\n",
    "5. Buying on margin means borrowing money from a broker in order to buy more securities than can be purchased with one’s own money alone. By buying securities on a margin, an investor magnifies both the upside potential and the downside risk. If the equity in a margin account falls below the required maintenance level, the investor will get a margin call from the broker.\n",
    "6. Short-selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own. The short-seller borrows the securities sold through a broker and may be required to cover the short position at any time on demand. The cash proceeds of a short sale are kept in escrow by the broker, and the broker usually requires that the short-seller deposit additional cash or securities to serve as margin (collateral) for the short sale.\n",
    "7. Securities trading is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, by other government agencies, and through self-regulation of the exchanges. Many of the important regulations have to do with full disclosure of relevant information concerning the securities in question. Insider trading rules also prohibit traders from attempting to profit from inside information.\n",

    "1. A level **3** subscriber to the NASDAQ system may enter bid and ask prices.  \n",
    ">NASDAQ has three levels of subscribers.  \n",
    "Level 3 subscribers, are registered market makers. These are firms that make a market in securities, maintain inventories of securities, and post bid and ask prices at which they are willing to buy or sell shares. Level 3 subscribers can enter and change bid–ask quotes continually and have the fastest execution of trades. They profit from the spread between bid and ask prices.  \n",
    "Level 2 subscribers receive all bid and ask quotes but cannot enter their own quotes. They can see which market makers are offering the best prices. These subscribers tend to be brokerage firms that execute trades for clients but do not actively deal in stocks for their own account.  \n",
    "Level 1 subscribers receive only inside quotes (i.e., the best bid and ask prices) but do not see how many shares are being offered. These subscribers tend to be investors who are not actively buying or selling but want information on current prices.\n",
