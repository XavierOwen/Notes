    "So that when $n$ becomes very large, we are actually assume that a **continuously compounded rates**, we have $1 + \\text{EAR} = e^{\\text{APR}} \\Rightarrow \\text{APR} = \\ln (1 + \\text{EAR}):= r_{cc}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inflation and The Real Rate of Interest\n",
    "**Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: measures the cost of purchasing a representative bundle of goods, the “consumption basket” of a typical urban family of four.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inflation rate**: $i$, the rate at which prices are rising, measured as the rate of increase of the CPI. \n",
    "\n",

    "**nominal interest rate**: The interest rate in terms of nominal (not adjusted for purchasing power) dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "**real interest rate**: The excess of the interest rate over the inflation rate. The growth rate of purchasing power derived from an investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Equilibrium Nominal Rate of Interest\n",
    "**Fisher equation**: the nominal rate increases one-for-one with increases in the expected inflation rate, $E(i)$.\n",

    "### Risk and Risk Premium\n",
    "What HPRs are possible, and how likely are they? \n",

    "**scenario analysis**: Process of devising a list of possible economic scenarios and specifying the likelihood of each one, as well as the HPR that will be realized in each case.\n",

    "$Conclusion$\n",
    "1. The return on a portfolio comprising two or more assets whose returns are normally distributed also will be normally distributed.\n",
    "2. The normal distribution is completely described by its mean and standard deviation. No other statistic is needed to learn about the behavior of normally distributed returns.\n",
    "3. The standard deviation is the appropriate measure of risk for a portfolio of assets with normally distributed returns. In this case, no other statistic can improve the risk assessment conveyed by the standard deviation of a portfolio.\n",

    "***\n",
    "**value at risk (VaR)**: Measure of downside risk. The worst loss that will be suffered with a given probability, often 5%: *How much would I lose in a fairly extreme outcome*\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\odot$\n",
    "A loss-averse investor might desire to limit portfolio VaR.$\\square$\n",
    "\n",
    "And when normally distributed, $\\text{VaR}$ can be calculated by following steps:\n",
    "1. Consider the probability that the worst loss would happen: like $\\alpha = 5\\%$ \n",
    "2. use this as the quantile and the $E(r)$, $\\sigma$ from the stock data to calculate the $\\text{VaR}$\n",
    "  1. Standard normal distribution, $\\Phi$: $\\text{VaR} = E(r) + [\\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha)]\\sigma$\n",
    "  2. Or directly get that from the Excel function `NORM.INV`: $\\text{VaR} = NORM.INV(\\alpha, E(r), \\sigma)$, meaning that for $X \\sim \\text{N}(E(r),\\sigma^2)$, $P[X \\leq \\alpha] = \\text{VaR}$\n",
    "  3. Discrete distribution, than sort them from low to high, count until reach the $\\alpha$ much part. For example you have $1000$ scenario with returns ordered from high to low, and your $\\alpha$ is $5\\%$, then you can count from the bottom to the $50$, and use the corresponding return as the value of $\\text{VaR}$.\n",
    "  4. Sometimes the interpolation is needed. When you need to count $3.6$ observation from the bottom, it will be the thrid rate plus $0.6$ multiple the difference between the third rate and the forth rate.\n",

    "When returns are normal, knowing just the mean and standard deviation allows us to fully describe the entire distribution. In that case, we do not need to estimate VaR explicitly—we can calculate it exactly from the properties of the normal distribution.

    "To avoid the costs of acquiring information on any individual stock or group of stocks, we may follow a \"neutral\" **diversification approach**. Select a diversified portfolio of common stocks that mirrors the corporate sector. This results in a *value-weighted* portfolio, which, for example, invests a proportion in GE stock that is equal to the ratio of GE’s market value to the market value of all listed stocks. And this strategy is called **indexing** (The rate of return on the portfolio replicates the return on the index).\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "- Investors face a trade-off between risk and expected return. Historical data confirm our intuition that assets with low degrees of risk should provide lower returns on average than do those of higher risk.\n",
    "- Shifting funds from the risky portfolio to the risk-free asset is the simplest way to reduce risk. Another method involves diversification of the risky portfolio. We take up diversification in later chapters.\n",
    "- U.S. T-bills provide a perfectly risk-free asset in nominal terms only. Nevertheless, the standard deviation of real rates on short-term T-bills is small compared to that of assets such as long-term bonds and common stocks, so for the purpose of our analysis, we consider T-bills the risk-free asset. Besides T-bills, money market funds hold short-term, safe obligations such as commercial paper and CDs. These entail some default risk but relatively little compared to most other risky assets. For convenience, we often refer to money market funds as risk-free assets.\n",
    "- A risky investment portfolio (referred to here as the risky asset) can be characterized by its Sharpe, or reward-to-volatility ratio. This ratio is the slope of the capital allocation line (CAL), the line connecting the risk-free asset to the risky asset. All combinations of the risky and risk-free asset lie on this line. Investors would prefer a steeper-sloping CAL, because that means higher expected returns for any level of risk.\n",
    "- An investor’s preferred choice among the portfolios on the capital allocation line will depend on risk aversion. Risk-averse investors will weight their complete portfolios more heavily toward Treasury bills. Risk-tolerant investors will hold higher proportions of their complete portfolios in the risky asset.\n",
    "- The capital market line is the capital allocation line that results from using a passive investment strategy that treats a market index portfolio, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500, as the risky asset. Passive strategies are low-cost ways of obtaining well-diversified portfolios with performance that will reflect that of the broad stock market.\n",
