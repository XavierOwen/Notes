    "## Summary\n",
    "- The expected rate of return of a portfolio is the weighted average of the component asset expected returns with the investment proportions as weights.\n",
    "- The variance of a portfolio is a sum of the contributions of the component-security variances *plus* terms involving the covariance among assets.\n",
    "- Even if correlations are positive, the portfolio standard deviation will be less than the weighted average of the component standard deviations, as long as the assets are not perfectly positively correlated. Thus, portfolio diversification is of value as long as assets are less than perfectly correlated.\n",
    "- The contribution of an asset to portfolio variance depends on its correlation with the other assets in the portfolio, as well as on its own variance. An asset that is perfectly negatively correlated with a portfolio can be used to reduce the portfolio variance to zero. Thus, it can serve as a perfect hedge.\n",
    "- A portfolio manager identifies the efficient frontier by first establishing estimates for the expected returns and standard deviations and determining the correlations among them. The input data are then fed into an optimization program that produces the investment proportions, expected returns, and standard deviations of the portfolios on the efficient frontier.\n",
    "- In general, portfolio managers will identify different efficient portfolios because of differences in the methods and quality of security analysis. Managers compete on the quality of their security analysis relative to their management fees.\n",
    "- If a risk-free asset is available and input data are identical, all investors will choose the same portfolio on the efficient frontier, the one that is tangent to the CAL. All investors with identical input data will hold the identical risky portfolio, differing only in how much each allocates to this optimal portfolio and to the risk-free asset. This result is characterized as the separation principle of portfolio selection.\n",
    "- The single-index model expresses the excess return on a security as a function of the market excess return: $R_i = \\alpha_i + \\beta_iR_m + e_i$. This equation also can be interpreted as a regression of the security excess return on the market-index excess return. The regression line has intercept $\\alpha_i$ and slope $\\beta_i$ and is called the security characteristic line (CAL).\n",
    "- In a single-index model, the variance of the rate of return on a security or portfolio can be decomposed into systematic and firm-specific risk. The systematic component of variance equals $\\beta_i^2$ times the variance of the market excess return. The firm-specific component is the variance of the residual term in the index-model equation.\n",
    "- The beta of a portfolio is the weighted average of the betas of the component securities. A security with negative beta reduces the portfolio beta, thereby reducing exposure to market volatility. The unique risk of a portfolio approaches zero as the portfolio becomes more highly diversified.\n",
