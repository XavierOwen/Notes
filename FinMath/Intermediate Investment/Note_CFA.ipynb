    "1. First determine whether an activity is illegal or unethical. The ideal situation is that nothing illegal or unethical took place. You should encourage your firm to develop and/or adopt a code of ethics and to establish procedures for reporting violations if it does not already have them.  \n",
    "*Sound ethics is fundamental to capital markets and the investment profession*\n",
    "2. It may not be easy to determine whether an activity is illegal or unethical. In this case, remember that taking action is better than inaction. You can seek the advice of your firm's compliance department or legal counsel.\n",
    "*Inaction combined with continued association with those involved in illegal or unethical conduct may be construed as participation or assistance in the illegal or unethical activity.*\n",
    "3. If it is illegal or unethical, you must take action to avoid being associated with that activity.\n",
    "  1. Stop the behavior.\n",
    "  2. If unsuccessful, bring to the compliance department's attention.\n",
    "  3. If the illegal or unethical activity continues, you must **dissociate**.\n",

    ">**e.g.**  \n",
    ">Now you suspect that your boss is basing his investment decisions on insider information, What do you do?\n",
    ">1. Do nothing because it's just an suspecion without provement.  \n",
    ">>Not good. Even you are helpless, inaction combined with the continuing association with your boss may be construed as participation or assistance in the illegal or unethical conduct.\n",
    ">2. Speak to your boss.  \n",
    ">>Not good. Although Standard I(A): Professionalism, Knowledge of the Law states that the first step to dissociate is to bring the matter to the attention of a supervisor or the firm’s compliance department, speaking with your boss who is the suspected violator may not be the safest choice. Your boss can seek retribution, or worse, fire you.\n",
    ">3. Document the treads in case someone else shares your suspecion.  \n",
    ">>You should definitely document your suspicions, but don’t stop there! Documenting the possible violation isn’t good enough according to the Code and Standards. To dissociate from the activity, you must use the documentation to urge your firm to persuade your boss to cease such conduct.\n",
    ">4. Seek the advice of the compliance department on the individual who is responsible for compliance at your firm.  \n",
    ">>Be sure to provide the compliance department with documentation supporting your concerns.\n",
    "***\n",
    ">Now the person responsible for compliance at your firm is on vacation. But later the compliance officer informs you that he and the firm’s president are familiar with the situation and know where your boss is getting his information. Besides, he tells you not to worry and escorts you out of his office. His parting words concern you: “If you want to keep your job with the firm, I suggest you keep your concerns to yourself.” What do you do?\n",
    ">1. Follow directions and keep your concerns to yourself. After all, you like you job and you don't want risk being unemployed.\n",
    ">>As difficult as it is to risk not following directions, doing nothing is not the best course of action. \n",
    ">2. As unsure as you might be, you resign your employment.\n",
    ">>The best course of action! You’ve followed the steps to dissociate by documenting your concerns and sharing them with the compliance officer. Because these actions were unsuccessful, you have the responsibility to step away and dissociate from the activity. Before resigning, you may want to seek the advice of the firm’s legal counsel. In addition to dissociating from the activity, be mindful of whether the situation warrants reporting the activity to a government or regulatory agency. If your boss or the compliance officer is subject to the CFA Institute Code and Standards, you should also report the activity to the CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program.\n",
    ">3. Seek the advice of the legal councel\n",

    "$Summary$  \n",
    "Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "You can:  \n",
    "1. Stay informed: work with your employer to establish a procedure by which you are regularly informed about changes in applicable laws, rules, regulations, and case law.\n",
    "2. Review procedures: Encourage your firm to review its written compliance procedures regularly to ensure that they reflect current law and provide adequate guidance about what is permissible conduct under the law and/or the Code and Standards.\n",
    "3. Maintain current files: current reference of these copies is vital. You may individually maintain, or encourage your employer to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your firm can:  \n",
    "1. Develop or Adopt a code of ethics and standards for professional conduct.\n",
    "2. Provide information about applicable laws. \n",

    "## Independence and Objectivity\n",
    "Professionalism, Independence and Objectivity, you should avoid situations that could cause or be perceived to cause a loss of independence or objectivity in recommending investments or taking investment action.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Members and Candidates must use reasonable care and judgment to achieve and maintain independence and objectivity in their professional activities. Members and Candidates must not offer, solicit, or accept any gift, benefit, compensation, or consideration that reasonably could be expected to compromise their own or another’s independence and objectivity.\n",

    "- Invitations to lavish events\n",
    "- Tickets\n",
    "- Favors\n",
    "- Job referrals\n",
    "- Additional compensation\n",
    "\n",

    ">1. You accept a research analyst position at a brokerage firm. Your compensation is partially based on the number of investment banking assignments you work on with the corporate finance team.\n",
    ">>COMPROMISED. Compensation arrangements should not link analyst remuneration directly to investment banking assignments in which you may participate as a team member.\n",
    "> 2. After disclosing the gift to your supervisor, you accept World Cup tickets from a client because of the exceptional service you provided.\n",
    ">> *probably* NOT COMPROMISED. Receiving a gift from a client can be distinguished from gifts given by entities seeking to influence you to the detriment of other clients. The potential for obtaining influence to the detriment of other clients, although present, is not as great as in situations where no compensation arrangement exists.\n",
    "> 3. You participate in a tour of a company’s headquarters and the company pays for chartered transportation, food, and lodging during the tour.\n",
    ">> COMPROMISED. Best practice dictates that you use commercial transportation rather than accept paid travel arrangements from an outside company. Should commercial transportation be unavailable, you may accept modestly arranged travel to participate in appropriate information gathering events, such as a property tour.\n",

    "$\\dagger$  \n",
    "You can't PARTICIPATE that!\n",

    "$Summary$  \n",
    "Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "You can:  \n",
    "1. Provide an unbiased opinion in research reports concerning a corporate client’s securities\n",
    "2. Encourage your firm to remove a company from the research universe and put it on a restricted list if the firm is unwilling to permit dissemination of an adverse opinion about the company\n",
    "3. Pay for commercial transportation and lodging when attending an issuer’s meeting\n",
    "4. Limit the acceptance of gratuities and/or gifts\n",
    "\n",
    "Your firm can:  \n",
    "1. Establish a policy that states research reports reflect an unbiased opinion  \n",
    "Design a compensation system that maintains analysts’ independence and objectivity\n",
    "2. Permit the dissemination of adverse opinions about a corporate client\n",
    "3. Establish a travel policy\n",
    "4. Set a strict value limit for acceptable gifts based on local customs  \n",
    "Determine whether the value limit is per gift or an aggregate annual value\n",
    "5. Require prior approval for employee participation in IPOs  \n",
    "Require employees to provide prompt disclosure of investment actions taken following the offering  \n",
    "Impose strict limits on investment personnel acquiring securities in private placements\n",
    "6. Implement supervisory and review procedures to ensure employees are complying with policies related to their personal investment activities\n",
    "7. Implement reporting structures so research analysts do not report to nor are supervised by a department that can compromise their independence and objectivity\n",
    "8. Appoint a senior officer to oversee compliance with the firm’s code of ethics\n",

    "## Misrepresentation\n",
    "Professionalism, Misrepresentation, you must not *knowingly* make any misrepresentations relating to investment analysis, recommendations, actions, or other professional activities.  \n",
    "*Knowingly means that you either know or should have known that the misrepresentation was being made or that information was omitted that would be of value for the investor in the investment decision-making process.*\n",

    "**Misrepresentation**: any untrue statement or omission of a fact or any statement that is otherwise false or misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid:  \n",
    "1. Be honest about your professional credentials and your firm’s performance\n",
    "2. Exercise care and due diligence when relying on third-party information\n",
    "3. Disclose the use of external managers\n",
    "4. Be forthcoming with the risk and unpredictability of investments\n",
    "5. Acknowledge sources of ideas and materials that are not yours\n",

    "$\\dagger$  \n",
    "Remember that research and models developed while employed by a firm *are the property of the firm*. The firm can issue *future reports* without attributing them to you, but they CANNOT reissue your *prior reports* in the name of *another analyst*. You CANNOT use historical recommendations or research reports created at a *previous firm* because the supporting documentation is unavailable. For future use, you must recreate the supporting records at a new firm with information gathered through public sources or directly from the company and not from memory or sources obtained at your previous employer.\n",

If you are comfortable accepting a slightly higher amount of risk in exchange for a return that is generally better than other *cash equivalent investments*, consider our Ultra-Short Fixed-Income Fund.\n",
    " \n",
    ">UltraShort can be a smarter alternative to investment in *money market funds* because it offers higher potential returns with only *marginally higher risk*. In addition, our UltraShort has the advantage of being free to use many investments *~~just outside the approved limits of money market funds~~*.\n",

    ">At MGM Capital, we classify your cash into two categories: Transactional cash and Investment cash. Transactional cash is typically generated from a recent transaction and is waiting for you to put it back to use in the very near term. *~~Investment cash~~* is generally a longer-term holding, often intended to provide enhanced diversification and liquidity as part of an overall portfolio allocation strategy. More active management of investment cash is required to tap its earnings potential. Investment cash can be invested over different time periods, generally producing higher earnings the longer the investment period. The UltraShort Fund would be a good place to place your investment cash.\n",
    " \n",
    ">Additional Information\n",
    " \n",
    ">The UltraShort Fund may not concentrate investments in a particular industry or group of industries. We have determined that mortgage-backed securities do not have risk characteristics that are correlated with any industry, and therefore, the fund has determined that *mortgage-backed securities are not part of any industry for purposes of the fund’s concentration policies*. This means that the fund may invest more than 25 percent of its total assets in mortgage-backed securities.\n",

    ">**Cash equivalent security**: a short-term security that is liquid enough to be considered equivalent to cash.  \n",
    ">**Money market fund**: a type of mutual fund that is required by law to invest in low-risk short-term securities, such as government securities (treasury bills), certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. The UltraShort’s investments lie considerably outside the approved limits of money market funds.  \n",
    ">*\"marginally higher risk\": the risk of a fund that invests heavily in long maturity and relatively illiquid residential mortgage-backed bonds is not comparable with the risk of a money market fund.*  \n",
    ">*\"just outside the approved limits of money market funds\": The law currently defines concentration as investing 25 percent or more of a portfolio’s assets in an industry or group of industries. The UltraShort fund was exposed to U.S. housing market risk and to the risk of poor mortgage loan underwriting practices through its residential mortgage-backed securities. Therefore, UltraShort violated concentration limits.*  \n",
    ">**Investment cash**: ***NOT a standard term*** in the investment management industry and it is being used to blur the distinction between cash and risky investments. In addition, the discussion of investment cash and transactional cash is part of the strategy to induce customers/clients to transfer cash from traditional money market funds and cash equivalents into the UltraShort Fund.  \n",
    "> *\"mortgage-backed securities are not part of any industry for purposes of the fund’s concentration policies\": Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) are not generally short-term securities; they generally have maturities of many years. In addition, they are not liquid enough to be considered cash equivalents. RMBS are debt obligations that represent claims to the cash flows from pools of home (residential) mortgage loans. The majority of the residential loans are securitized by private issuers who did not provide meaningful credit insurance. As a result, investors in RMBS bear the risk that homeowners will default on their mortgages.*  \n",
    "> *\"Below is a comparison of the return on the YieldPlus Fund with a 9–12 month U.S. Treasury Index\": It is inappropriate to compare the return on the UltraShort Fund with the return on Treasury securities included in the index because the Treasury securities have no credit risk, are highly liquid, and have short maturities. The holdings in the UltraShort Fund share none of these attributes. In other words\n",
    ">1. the index effectively has no credit risk. In contrast, the UltraShort Fund is exposed to a substantial amount of credit risk through its holdings of residential mortgage-backed securities, its corporate bonds, and asset-backed securities holdings.\n",
    ">2. The UltraShort Fund holds securities with maturities longer than 9–12 months.\n",
    ">3. Treasury securities are traded in extremely liquid markets. In contrast, the UltraShort Fund has securities that are relatively illiquid to begin with.*\n",
    ">\n",
    ">*\"Total Return\"*: the difference in total return over the period reflected is because of the higher yield and riskier nature of the residential mortgage-backed securities in the UltraShort Fund.\n",

    "you may use significant conclusions derived from the analysis of public and nonmaterial nonpublic information as the basis for investment recommendations and decisions even if those conclusions would have been material inside information had they been communicated directly to you by a company.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **e.g.**\n",
    ">Nothing is inherently unethical about investment professionals making money from personal investments as long as\n",
    "1. the client is not disadvantaged by the trade\n",
    "2. the investment professional does not benefit personally from trades undertaken by clients\n",
    "3. the investment professional complies with applicable regulatory requirements.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">You will violate the Code and Standards by trading on material nonpublic information. Investment professionals who possess material nonpublic information that could affect the value of an investment must not act or cause others to act on the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following procedures can help to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information.\n",
    " \n",
    "1. **Achieve public dissemination**: If an investment professional determines that information is material, he/she should make reasonable efforts to achieve public dissemination of the information. This effort usually entails encouraging the issuer company to make the information public. If public dissemination is not possible, the investment professional must communicate the information only to the designated supervisory and compliance personnel within the firm and must not take investment action or alter current investment recommendations on the basis of this information.\n",
    "2. **Adopt compliance procedures**: Investment professionals should encourage their firms to adopt compliance procedures to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information. Particularly important is improving compliance in such areas as the review of employee and proprietary trading, documentation of firm procedures, and the supervision of interdepartmental communications in multiservice firms.\n",
    "3. **Adopt disclosure procedures**: Investment professionals should encourage their firms to develop and follow disclosure procedures designed to ensure that information is disseminated to the marketplace in an equitable manner.\n",
    "4. **Issue press releases**: Companies should consider issuing press releases prior to analyst meetings and conference calls and scripting those meetings and calls to decrease the chance that further information will be disclosed. If material nonpublic information is disclosed for the first time during an analyst meeting or call, the company should promptly issue a press release or otherwise make the information publicly available.\n",
    "5. **Firewall elements**: An information barrier commonly referred to as a “firewall” is the most widely used approach to preventing the communication of material nonpublic information. It restricts the flow of confidential information to those who need to know the information to perform their jobs effectively. The minimum elements of such a system include, but are not limited to, the following:\n",
    "    - Substantial control of relevant interdepartmental communications preferably through a clearance area within the firm in either the compliance or legal department;\n",
    "    - Review of employee trading through the maintenance of “watch,” “restricted,” and “rumor” lists;\n",
    "    - Documentation of the procedures designed to limit the flow of information between departments and of the actions taken to enforce those procedures;\n",
    "    - Heightened review or restriction of proprietary trading while a firm is in possession of material nonpublic information.\n",
    "6. **Physical separation of departments**: To the extent possible, firms should consider the physical separation of departments and files to prevent the communication of sensitive information that should not be shared.\n",
    "7. **Prevention of personnel overlap**: There should be no overlap of personnel between the investment banking and corporate finance areas of a brokerage firm and the sales and research departments or between a bank’s commercial lending department and its trust and research departments.\n",
    "8. **A reporting system**: A primary objective of an effective firewall procedure is to establish a reporting system in which authorized people review and approve communications between departments. If an employee behind a firewall believes that he or she needs to share confidential information with someone on the other side of the wall, the employee should consult a designated compliance officer to determine whether sharing the information is necessary and how much information is shared.\n",
    "9. **Personal trading limitations**: Firms should consider restrictions or prohibitions on personal trading by employees and should carefully monitor both proprietary trading and personal trading by employees. Firms should require employees to make periodic reports (to the extent that such reporting is not already required by  securities laws) of their own transactions and transactions made for the benefit of family members. Securities should be placed on a restricted list when a firm has or may have material nonpublic information. The broad distribution of a restricted list often triggers the sort of trading the list was developed to avoid. Therefore, a watch list shown to only the few people responsible for compliance should be used to monitor transactions in specified securities. The use of a watch list in combination with a restricted list is an increasingly common means of ensuring effective control of personal trading.\n",
    "10. **Proprietary trading procedures**: Procedures concerning the restriction or review of a firm’s proprietary trading while it possesses material nonpublic information will necessarily depend on the type of proprietary trading in which a firm may engage. A prohibition on all types of proprietary activity when a firm comes into possession of material nonpublic information is not appropriate because it could be counterproductive to the goals of maintaining the confidentiality of the information and market liquidity.\n",
    "11. **Communication to all employees**: Written compliance policies and guidelines should be circulated to all employees of the firm. Policies and guidelines should be used in conjunction with training programs aimed at enabling employees to recognize material nonpublic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **e.g.**\n",
    "> Which of policies and procedures regarding the misuse of material nonpublic information is not consistent with the best practices in the Standards of Practice Handbook?\n",
    ">\n",
    ">1. If investment personnel determine that information they possess is material and nonpublic, they should disseminate it to the public.\n",
    "2. Any information disclosed by a corporation at a meeting with analysts should be considered public information.\n",
    "3. ~~All communications between the research department and the corporate finance department will go through the legal department.~~\n",
    "4. ~~A “restricted” list will be established and all employee trading will be reviewed based on this list.~~\n",
    "5. ~~There will be no overlap of personnel between the investment banking and corporate finance areas and the sales and research departments.~~\n",
    "6. Market making in a company’s stock is prohibited when the firm possesses material nonpublic information about that company.\n",

    "## Market Manipulation\n",
    "Members and Candidates must not engage in practices that distort prices or artificially inflate trading volume with the intent to mislead market participants.\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "1. identify information-based manipulation.\n",
    "2. identify transaction-based manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information-Based Manipulation**: It includes, but is not limited to, spreading false rumors to induce trading by others.\n",

    "**Transaction-Based Manipulation**: instances where an investor (individual or institution) intends to mislead market participants by taking actions that could affect the price of a security. It includes but not limited to\n",
    "1. transactions that artificially affect prices or volume to give the impression of activity or price movement in a financial instrument, which represents a diversion from the expectations of a fair and efficient market\n",
    "2. securing a controlling, dominant position in a financial instrument to exploit and manipulate the price of a related derivative and/or the underlying asset\n",

    "## Assessment\n",
    "1. Material information is information that\n",
    "    - would probably change the price of a security.\n",
    "    - a reasonable investor would want to know before making a decision.\n",
    "    - ~~would give competitors an unfair advantage.~~\n",
    "2. True about material information\n",
    "    - The more ambiguous the effect of the information on a security’s price, the less material the information.\n",
    "    - The passage of time may render material information immaterial.\n",
    "    - ~~The source of the information does not affect its materiality.~~\n",
    "3. Nonpublic information is information that a company has only:\n",
    "    - disclosed to a room full of analysts.\n",
    "4. According to the Mosaic Theory, a member\n",
    "    - can use material public information or nonmaterial nonpublic information in their analysis even if it would have been considered material information if disclosed by the company.\n",
    "    - ~~will violate the Code and Standards if they fail to have knowledge of and comply with all applicable laws.~~\n",
    "    - ~~will violate the Code and Standards if they use information collected from the companies’ customers, contractors, suppliers, and competitors.~~\n",
    "5. Which of the following transactions are acceptable under the standard on market manipulation?\n",
    "    - ~~Buying 10,000 shares of a security near the close of the day’s trading, when its average daily trading volume is 100,000 shares.~~\n",
    "    - ~~Buying a security with low turnover and subsequently placing contemporaneous buy and sell orders for that security.~~\n",
    "    - Acquiring a controlling position in a stock in order to affect the price of its call options.\n",
    "6. Which is material information\n",
    "    - The retired CEO of Beech Inc. discussing an expected increase in Beech Inc.’s dividends next quarter.\n",
    "    - ~~The CFO of a competitor discussing a potential bankruptcy at Beech Inc.~~\n",
    "    - ~~A change in auditor notification at Beech Inc.~~\n",
    "7. If a member determines that information is material, they should\n",
    "    - publicly disseminate the information.\n",
    "    - ~~encourage the issuer to make the information public.~~\n",
    "    - ~~only communicate the information to their supervisory or compliance personnel.~~\n",
    "8. Which of the following statements is a recommendation of the Standards of Practice Handbook to prevent the communication of material nonpublic information within firms?\n",
    "    - Review employee trading through the maintenance of a “watch or restricted” list.\n",
