    "# Capital Asset Pricing and Arbitrage Pricing Theory\n",
    "Historically CAPM comes prior to the index model, and we use the index model to help understand the lessons of the CAPM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index model: $R_i = \\beta_iR_M + \\alpha_i + e_i$, where $\\alpha$ is the expected firm-specific return and $e_i$ is the \"noise\" with zero-mean. And given the market excess return, $R_M$, we have the expected excess return on a stock: $E[R_i \\mid R_m] = \\beta_i R_M + \\alpha_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "That means manager will persue a higher $\\alpha$ portfolio, or even short the one with negative $\\alpha$. Conversely, the drop in demand for a negative-alpha stock will reduce its price, pushing its alpha back toward zero. In the end, such buying or selling pressure will leave most securities with zero alpha values most of the time.\n",

    "## The Capital Asset Pricing Model\n",
    "### The Model: Assumptions and Implications\n",
    "**capital asset pricing model (CAPM)**: A model that relates the required rate of return on a security to its systematic risk as measured by beta.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditions that lead to the CAPM ensure competitive security markets, where investors will choose identical efficient portfolios using the mean-variance criterion:\n",
    "1. Markets for securities are perfectly competitive and equally profitable to all investors.\n",
    "    1. No investor is sufficiently wealthy that his or her actions alone can affect market prices.\n",
    "    2. All information relevant to security analysis is publicly available at no cost.\n",
    "    3. All securities are publicly owned and traded, and investors may trade all of them. Thus, all risky assets are in the investment universe.\n",
    "    4. There are no taxes on investment returns. Thus, all investors realize identical returns from securities.\n",
    "    5. Investors confront no transaction costs that inhibit their trading.\n",
    "    6. Lending and borrowing at a common risk-free rate are unlimited.\n",
    "2. Investors are alike in every way except for initial wealth and risk aversion; hence, they all choose investment portfolios in the same manner.\n",
    "    1. Investors plan for the same (single-period) horizon.\n",
    "    2. Investors are rational, mean-variance optimizers.\n",
    "    3. Investors are efficient users of analytical methods, and by assumption 1.B they have access to all relevant information. Hence, they use the same inputs and consider identical portfolio opportunity sets. This assumption is often called **homogeneous expectations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or in short, the most important parts:\n",
    "1. Investors cannot affect prices.\n",
    "2. One identical holding period for all investors.\n",
    "3. No taxes and transaction costs.\n",
    "4. All investors have unlimited risk-free borrowing/lending ability.\n",
    "5. All investors form portfolios based on all assets, analyze securities in the same way, and reach the same optimal risky portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "$Conclusion$\n",
    "1. All investors will choose to hold the **market portfolio** (M) (*The portfolio for which each security is held in proportion to its total market value*), which includes all assets of the security universe. For simplicity, we shall refer to all assets as stocks. The proportion of each stock in the market portfolio equals the market value of the stock (price per share times the number of shares outstanding) divided by the total market value of all stocks.\n",
    "2. The market portfolio will be on the *efficient frontier*. Moreover, it will be the optimal risky portfolio, the tangency point of the *capital allocation line* (CAL) to the efficient frontier. As a result, the ***capital market line*** (CML), the line from the risk-free rate through the market portfolio, M, is also the best attainable capital allocation line. All investors hold M as their optimal risky portfolio, differing only in the amount invested in it versus in the risk-free asset.\n",
    "3. The risk premium on the market portfolio will be proportional to the variance of the market portfolio and investors' typical degree of risk aversion. Mathematically,\n",
    "$$E(r_M) - r_f = \\bar{A}\\sigma_M^2$$\n",
    "where $\\sigma_M$ is the standard deviation of the return on the market portfolio and $\\bar{A}$ represents the degree of risk aversion of the average investor.\n",
    "4. The risk premium on individual assets will be proportional to the risk premium on the market portfolio (M) and to the *beta coefficient* of the security on the market portfolio. *Beta* measures the extent to which returns respond to the market portfolio. Formally, beta is the regression (slope) coefficient of the security return on the market return, representing sensitivity to fluctuations in the overall security market.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why All Investors Would Hold the Market Portfolio\n",
    "1. ***Given all assumptions, all the investors will arrive at the same determination of the optimal risky portfolio.***\n",
    "2. The market portfolio is no more than the aggregate of all individual portfolios. So the market portfolio should also arrive at the same optimal risky portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "And a stock price will fall if not in the portfolio, then it becomes more attractive and return in the portfolio, so that all stocks will be included in the optimal portfolio. The only issue is the price. Here's the bottom line\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\odot$ If all investors hold an *identical* risky portfolio, this portfolio must be the *market portfolio*. So that the market portfolio becomes the optimal risky portfolio (CML becomes the optimal CAL), and all investors hold the market portfolio.$\\triangleleft$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Passive Strategy Is Efficient\n",
    "The CAPM implies that a passive strategy, using the CML as the optimal CAL, is a powerful alternative to an active strategy. And an active investor who chooses any other portfolio will end on a CAL that is inferior to the CML used by passive investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**mutual fund theorem**: States that all investors desire the same portfolio of risky assets and can be satisfied by a single mutual fund composed of that portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Risk Premium of the Market Portfolio\n",
    "$$E(r_M) - r_f = \\bar{A}\\sigma_M^2$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Expected Returns on Individual Securities\n",
    "**expected return (mean return)–beta relationship**: Implication of the CAPM that security risk premiums (expected excess returns) will be proportional to beta.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(r_D) = r_f + \\beta_D(E(r_M) - r_f)$$\n",

    "**security market line (SML)**: Graphical representation of the expected return-beta relationship of the CAPM.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Raw/SML.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever the CAPM holds, all securities must lie on the SML. Underpriced stocks plot above the SML: Given beta, their expected returns are greater than is indicated by the CAPM. Overpriced stocks plot below the SML. The difference between fair and actual expected rates of return on a stock is the **alpha**, $\\alpha$: *The abnormal rate of return on a security in excess of what would be predicted by an equilibrium model such as the CAP*. And the expected return on a mispriced security is given by $E(r_s) = \\alpha_s + r_f + \\beta_s[E(r_M) – r_f]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And larger $\\alpha$, better profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha_s = E(r_s) - r_f - \\beta_s[E(r_m) - r_f]$$\n",

    "In capital budgeting decisions: the SML provides the required return demanded of the project. \n",

    "Limitation of CAPM\n",
    "1. It relies on the theoretical market portfolio, which includes all assets (such as real estate, foreign stocks, etc.)\n",
    "2. It applies to expected as opposed to actual returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we use actual portfolios rather than the theoretical market portfolio, to represent the systematic factor. These could be S&P 500 and other index.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "- The CAPM assumes investors are rational, single-period planners who agree on a common input list from security analysis and seek mean-variance optimal portfolios.\n",
    "- The CAPM assumes ideal security markets in the sense that (a) markets are large and investors are price takers, (b) there are no taxes or transaction costs, (c) all risky assets are publicly traded, and (d) any amount can be borrowed and lent at a fixed, risk-free rate. These assumptions mean that all investors will hold identical risky portfolios. The CAPM implies that, in equilibrium, the market portfolio is the unique mean-variance efficient tangency portfolio, which indicates that a passive strategy is efficient.\n",
    "- The market portfolio is a value-weighted portfolio. Each security is held in a proportion equal to its market value divided by the total market value of all securities. The risk premium on the market portfolio is proportional to its variance, σ2M and to the risk aversion of the average investor.\n",
    "Page 221- The CAPM implies that the risk premium on any individual asset or portfolio is the product of the risk premium of the market portfolio and the asset’s beta. The security market line shows the return demanded by investors as a function of the beta of their investment. This expected return is a benchmark for evaluating investment performance.\n",
    "- In a single-index security market, once an index is specified, a security beta can be estimated from a regression of the security’s excess return on the index’s excess return. This regression line is called the security characteristic line (SCL). The intercept of the SCL, called alpha, represents the average excess return on the security when the index excess return is zero. The CAPM implies that alphas should be zero.\n",
    "- The CAPM and the security market line can be used to establish benchmarks for evaluation of investment performance or to determine appropriate discount rates for capital budgeting applications. They are also used in regulatory proceedings concerning the “fair” rate of return for regulated industries.\n",
    "- The CAPM is usually implemented as a single-factor model, with all systematic risk summarized by the return on a broad market index. However, multifactor generalizations of the basic model may be specified to accommodate multiple sources of systematic risk. In such multifactor extensions of the CAPM, the risk premium of any security is determined by its sensitivity to each systematic risk factor as well as the risk premium associated with that source of risk.\n",
    "- There are two general approaches to finding extra-market systematic risk factors. One is characteristics based and looks for factors that are empirically associated with high average returns and so may be proxies for relevant measures of systematic risk. The other focuses on factors that are plausibly important sources of risk to wide segments of investors and may thus command risk premiums.\n",
    "- An arbitrage opportunity arises when the disparity between two or more security prices enables investors to construct a zero net investment portfolio that will yield a sure profit. The presence of arbitrage opportunities and the resulting volume of trades will create pressure on security prices that will persist until prices reach levels that preclude arbitrage. Only a few investors need to become aware of arbitrage opportunities to trigger this process because of the large volume of trades in which they will engage.\n",
    "- When securities are priced so that there are no arbitrage opportunities, the market satisfies the no-arbitrage condition. Price relationships that satisfy the no-arbitrage condition are important because we expect them to hold in real-world markets.\n",
    "- Portfolios are called well diversified if they include a large number of securities in such proportions that the residual or diversifiable risk of the portfolio is negligible.\n",
    "- In a single-factor security market, all well-diversified portfolios must satisfy the expected return–beta relationship of the SML in order to satisfy the no-arbitrage condition. If all well-diversified portfolios satisfy the expected return–beta relationship, then all but a small number of securities also must satisfy this relationship.\n",
    "- The APT implies the same expected return–beta relationship as the CAPM yet does not require that all investors be mean-variance optimizers. The price of this generality is that the APT does not guarantee this relationship for all securities at all times.\n",
    "- A multifactor APT generalizes the single-factor model to accommodate several sources of systematic risk.\n",
