## Structure

Difference between the introduction section and the discussion section.

|Introduction|Discussion|
|:-|:-|
|The introduction moves from a general broad focus to the narrower report section.|The discussion moves away from this narrow section to a wider, more general focus.|
|I should write about the work of other researchers, creating a kind of research map for my readers so that they can see what type of work existed in this field.|I should locate my study in relation to this research map.|
|Then I locate a gap in the research or describe a problem associated with existing research.|Then I say to what extent I have responded to this gap or solved the problem.|
|At the end of the introduction, I can write about the present paper, creating an interface with the content of my own work so that I could move the reader on the central report section.|At the beginning of the discussion, I can revisit some aspect of my work, so as to create that interface in reverse and enable me to move away from the central report section.|

## Writing Task

Here is an example article. It's title is *cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) skills and quality of life in stress-related disorders*, and below is its discussion section. What is the purpose of each sentences?

|Sentence Number|Sentence|Purpose|Note|
|:-:|:-|:-|:-|
|1.1|Prior work has documented the effectiveness of psychosocial intervention in improving quality of life (QoL) and reducing stress in patients suffering from various disorders; Epstein,<sup>18</sup> for example, reports that orthopedic patients participating in a two-week multimedia intervention programme improved across several QoL indices, including interpersonal conflict and mental health. |to revisit previous research|I can revisit the introduction to restate the aims of the paper, important background factual information, the original prediction/theory/assumption, the problem the study was designed to solve. I can revisit the methodology for a reminder of the rationale for the procedures, or a summary of the procedures themselves. I can revisit the results for a summary of the results obtained by others or by myself.|
|1.2|However, these studies have either been short-term studies or have not focused on patients whose disorder was stress-related. | to revisit the introduction to recall specific weakness in the methodology used in previous studies.|After revisiting, I can move on to the specific differences between the methodology in the present work and that of previous work.|
|1.3|In this study we tested the extent to which an extended three-month stress management programme improved QoL among a group of patients being treated for stress-related skin disorders such as eczema.|to revisit the methodology used in this study.|I should recall the significant features of my method here, and avoid adding new information.|
|2.4|We found that in virtually all cases, participation in our three-month stress management programme was associated with substantial increases in the skills needed to improve QoL. |to revisit and summarize the results|Summarizing the results provides an appropriate start point to go beyond the results|
|2.5|These findings extend those of Kaliom, confirming that a longer, more intensive period of stress-management training tends to produce more effective skills than when those skills are input over a shorter period via information transfer media such as leaflets and presentations (Kaliom et al., 2003). |to show where and how the present work fits into the research map of this field|I should now fit my work into the research map to make the relationship between my study and other work explicit. So I should answer question like, comparing to what, what changes I have done.|
|2.6|In addition, the improvements noted in our study were unrelated to age, gender or ethnic background. |to recall an aspect of the results that represents a positive achievement or contribution of this work|I should use positive language to present the benefits or advantages of my work. I need to answer how my work affects the current stage of knowledge.|
|2.7|This study therefore indicates that the benefits gained from stress-management intervention may address QoL needs across a wide range of patients.| to discuss the meaning and implications of the achievements of my work|I need to suggest why results occurred as they did and offer an explanation of the mechanisms behind your findings and observations here. I can try to answer the following questions. What the results mean in that context. How do the results relate to the original question or problem? Are your results consistent with what other investigators have reported? If your results were unexpected, try to explain why. Is there another way to interpret your results? The last tip is to use more modal verbs here.|
|3.8|Most notably, this is the first study to our knowledge to investigate the effectiveness of extended psychosocial intervention in patients whose disorder is itself thought to be stress-related. |to note that one of the achievements or contributions of this work is its novelty|For novelty, check as thoroughly as possible that no-one has ever done a particular type of study until now.|
|3.9|Our results provide compelling evidence for long-term involvement with such patients and suggest that this approach appears to be effective in counteracting stress that may exacerbate the disorder. |to refine the implications of the results, including possible applications|In case there're none applications, I can clarify a theory.|
|3.10, 3.11|However, some limitations are worth noting. Although our hypotheses were supported statistically, the sample was not reassessed once the programme was over. |to describe the limitations which should direct future research|I can also mention some positive outcomes.|
|3.12|Future work should therefore include follow-up work designed to evaluate whether the skills are retained in the long term and also whether they continue to be used to improve QoL.|to suggest a specific area to be addressed in future work|Where should the research go next? Kindly invite the research community to follow my work.|
