## Structure

1. Abstract
2. Introduction
   - write an opening sentence which enables the reader to "get in" or start my paper/thesis
   - start by been fairly general and gradually narrow the focus
   - interface with the central report at the end
3. Methodology: central report
4. Results: central report
5. Discussion or conclusion
   - interface with the central report at the beginning
   - find an acceptable way to end the paper/thesis to "get out" the paper/thesis
   - start by been focused and gradually been general

## Grammar and Writing Skills

- tense pairs
- signalling language
- passive/active use
- paragraphing

### Tense pairs

|Tense|Usage|Format|Example|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|present simple|describe a general fact as I believe or with references |sth. do/does|the prediction error decreases as the particle number increases|
|past simple|describe a fact not generally accepted, or relevant to present|sth. did|He published the result in 1998.|
|present perfect|describe a fact happened in the past but relevant to present|sth has/have done|Little attention has been paid to the selection of variables.|

### Signalling language

How to connect sentences?

- overlap, to repeat something from the previous sentence
- use a pronoun (it, they) or pro-form (this, these)
- use semicolon or a relative clause
  - joining sentences with a semicolon works well when two sentences are very closely related and one of them is quite short
- use signalling sentence connector (therefore, however)

Besides *therefore* and *however*, there are more signalling words.

|Indication|Words|Note|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Cause|due to (the fact that), on account of, in view of, as, because, since|These words can start a sentence. Avoid using *since* if there would be confusion.|
|Result|as a result (of which), which is why, therefore, consequently, hence, so|Don't start sentences with *so*.|
|Contract/Difference|on the other hand, by contrast, however, whereas, but, while|*On the contrary* and *conversely* communicate the fact that 'exactly the opposite is true'. Avoid using *while* if there would be confusion.|
|Unexpectedness|although, even though, though, despite, in spite of, regardless of, notwithstanding, nevertheless, however, yet, nonetheless, even so|*Still* and *anyway* are more informal|
|Addition|in addition, moreover, furthermore, apart from that/which, also, secondly, in the second place, what is more|*Besides* is more powerful and is therefore better used in more persuasive contexts.|

And more signalling words can be found in [this online document](https://massasoit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/writing-center-Signal-Words.pdf).

### Passive/Active

How to refer to myself or my group?

- use *we* to refer to my research group, not people in general; otherwise use *it is known that*.
- use passive instead of *we*, especially in the central report.
- use *this article/paper* instead of *I/we*

### Paragraphing

What are the two common errors in paragraphing?

- clusters of short or single-sentence paragraphs
- paragraphs that are too long

How to skim and how skimming helps me to write?

- skimming steps
  1. read the title
  2. look at the authors, date, and other metadata
  3. read the abstract
  4. look quickly at the first paragraph
  5. look quickly at the first sentence of each paragraph
  6. look quickly at each figure/table and read its title
  7. read the last paragraph
- A paragraph in academic writing often stars with a topic sentence, which gives the main idea of this paragraph. The other sentences are related to the main idea.
- When the idea moves too far way from the first sentence, start a new paragraph.

## Writing Task

Here is an example article. It's title is *the synthesis of flexible polymer blends from polylactide and rubber*, and below is its introduction section. What is the purpose of each sentences?

|Sentence Number|Sentence|Purpose|Note|
|:-:|:-|:-|:-|
|1.1|Polylactide (PLA) has received much attention in recent years due to its biodegradable properties, which offer important economic benefits.|To establish the importance of the research object|Yes, my research is important and useful. I can write *In the past five years, much study has focused on that. There are substantial benefits to be gained from this.*|
|1.2|PLA is a polymer obtained from corn and is produced by the polymerisation of lactide.|To provide general background information|Background info can be stated using present simple sense. And info that is more general comes first. Don't forget references.|
|1.3|It has many possible uses in the biomedical field<sup>1</sup> and has also been investigated as a potential engineering material.<sup>2,3</sup>|To support sentence 1.1 and 1.2 with references|This part is more like general background thus is presented in the present simple tense. Also include references to void plagiarism. Literature review is longer and comes later in the second paragraph.|
|1.4|However, it has been found to be too weak under impact to be used commercially.<sup>4</sup>|To mention the general problem area or the current research focus|The specific problem should come next.|
|2.5|One way to toughen polymers is to incorporate a layer of rubber particles<sup>5</sup> and there has been extensive research regarding the rubber modification of PLA.|To transit between the general problem and the literature review|A general rule: I should always include references to previous or current research wherever it is useful|
|2.6|For example, Penney *et al*. showed that PLA composites could be prepared using blending techniques<sup>6</sup> and more recently, Hillier established the toughness of such composites.<sup>7</sup>|To provide a brief overview of the key research projects in this area|The studies should be listed in order. For example chronological order, or from general research to specific research. I can also group projects according to their approaches, theories, and models.|
|2.7|However, although the effect of the rubber particles on the mechanical properties of copolymer systems was demonstrated over two years ago,<sup>8</sup> little attention has been paid to the selection of an appropriate rubber component.|To describe a gap in the research|This is where I begin to introduce the purpose of my paper and the specific problem I will deal with. Usually there will be more background knowledge before introducing this gap.|
|3.8|The present paper presents a set of criteria for selecting such a component.|To describe this paper|I can use the present simple tense to describe this paper, like *this paper is organized as follows*, or *this study focuses on*; and the past simple tense to talk about the aim, like *the aim of this project was*.|
|3.9|On the basis of these criteria it then describes the preparation of a set of polymer blends using PLA and a hydro-carbon rubber (PI).|To give details about the methodology|Don't go into too much detail.|
|3.10|This combination of two mechanistically distinct polymerisations formed a novel copolymer in which the incorporation of PI significantly increased flexibility. |To announce the findings|Don't forget to use the pro-form|

Some tips:

- Don't be too strong on criticism.
- When you are describing what each chapter will do, use different verbs on each chapter.

Good Luck on the introduction!
