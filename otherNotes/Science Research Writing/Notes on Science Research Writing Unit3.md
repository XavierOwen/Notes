## Structure

This section reports my comments on what I found and the title of this section varies in different journals. Remember the figures and tables don't speak for themselves, and I should explain to my reader about the results.

- label the figures and tables and use reference number to indicate the results I am explaining.
- numbers are already visible to my readers. I should explain the meaning of them to help the readers understand why I feel this is good or bad, using the words in the following subsections.

## Grammar and Writing Skills

## Writing Task

Here is an example article. It's title is *A modelling approach to traffic management and CO exposure during peak hours* and below is its results section. What is the purpose of each sentences?

|Sentence Number|Sentence|Purpose|Note|
|:-:|:-|:-|:-|
|1.1, 1.2|Data obtained in previous studies<sup>1,2</sup> using a fixed on-site monitor indicated that travel by car resulted in lower CO exposure than travel on foot. According to Figo et al. (1999), the median exposure of car passengers was 11% lower than for those walking.<sup>2</sup> |to refer to the findings and conclusions obtained by other researchers|To start, I can write a overview sentence, or refer back to something from previous sections, like the general aim, the specific problems, the methodology, the original prediction/assumption, the findings of other research. The re-stating strategy can help my readers see the relations of my results and previous results.|
|1.3, 1.4|In our study, modelled emission rates were obtained using the Traffic Emission Model (TEM), a  CO-exposure modelling framework developed by Ka.<sup>3</sup> Modelled results were compared with actual roadside CO concentrations measured hourly at a fixed monitor.|to refer back to my own methodology and adds more information about it|It's OK to re-state background information, to summarize my methodology. All for one purpose, that the readers can catch up and understand easily.|
|1.5|Figure 1 shows the results obtained using TEM.|to invite the reader to look at a graph/figure/table etc.|Following the short summary of the methodology, I can put my results in a graph here. And the following would be my comments.|
|2.6|As can be seen, during morning peak-time journeys the CO concentrations for car passengers were significantly lower than for pedestrians, which is consistent with results obtained in previous studies.<sup>2</sup> |to refer to specific results and compare them with those obtained in another study|I need to compare my results with those of other researchers so my readers should know where my results fit in with the existing research picture. I should use subjective, evaluative language to notice the readers about the key points.|
|2.7|However, the modelled data were not consistent with these results for afternoon journeys. |to offer a general statement about the results to begin a new paragraph|Something interesting happened, and I can move on to the next paragraph.|
|3.8|Although the mean CO concentrations modelled by TEM for afternoon journeys on foot were in line with those of Figo et al., a striking difference was noted when each of the three peak hours was considered singly (Fig. 2). |to refer to specific results and compares them to those obtained in another study|For interesting results, I can discuss it with more detail. To avoid using exclamation marks (!), I can use words like *striking*, *shocking*. Start with *although* can also help my readers predict the function of the sentence faster.|
|3.9, 3.10|It can be observed that during the first hour (H<sub>1</sub>) of the peak period, journeys on foot resulted in a considerably lower level of CO exposure. Although levels for journeys on foot generally exceeded those modelled for car journeys during H<sub>2</sub>, during the last hour (H<sub>3</sub>) the levels for journeys on foot were again frequently far lower than for car journeys.|to select specific results to describe in more detail|I can explain the result by saying why it occurred; I can evaluate it by saying how good/bad the numbers is, and I can implicate it by saying what the result suggests or implies. Do this only for the interesting results.|
|4.11|A quantitative analysis to determine modelling uncertainties was applied, based on the maximum deviation of the measured and calculated levels within the considered period. | to refer to the method used to analyze the results|The methodology section often only deals with the basic structure and components of the materials and methods. And most details are incorporated into the results section.|
|4.12|Based on this approach, the average uncertainty of the model prediction for this study slightly exceeds the 50% acceptability limit defined by Jiang.<sup>7</sup> |to mention a problem in the results|Remember to minimize the problem, suggest possible reasons and offer a solution.|
|4.13|Nevertheless, these results suggest that data obtained using TEM to simulate CO exposures may provide more sensitive information for assessing the impact of traffic management strategies than traditional on-site measurement.|to make a reference to the implications and applications of the work he has done|The last sentence of the results section can connect to the first sentence of the discussion section, so some indication is OK here.|

Some funny code.

- I can't remember the reference -> It has long been know that
- This is interesting to me -> This is of great theoretical and practical importance
- The experiments didn't work out -> It has not been possible to provide definite answers to these questions
- Composition unknown -> High purity
- THe results of the others didn't make sense, so we ignored them -> THree of the samples were chosen for detailed study
- Only the best results are shown -> Typical results are shown
- It is impossible to tell much from the original micrograph -> Although some detail has been lost in reproduction, it appears to be clear from the original micrograph that
- good -> perfect
- fair -> excellent
- poor -> good
- very poor -> reasonably good
- awful -> satisfactory
- really awful -> fail
- imaginary -> not perfect
- non-existent -> as good as can be expected
- I might get round to this sometime if I don't change careers -> These results will be reported at a later date
- I think that -> It is suggested/believed that, It seems that
- I don't understand it -> It is clear that much additional work is required before a complete understanding can be reached
- Neither does anyone else -> Unfortunately, a quantitative theory to account for these effects has not yet been formulated
- Wrong -> Correct within an order of magnitude
- This paper isn't very good, but neither is anyone else's -> It is hoped that this work will stimulate further research
- but impossible to prove -> It is obvious
