# How to Write a Research Paper

## Notes

### General guideline

I did something others haven't done and obtained certain results The methodology is how I did. Now I need to sell it to my readers.

- I need to show them the general research area and where my research fits in
- I need to show them how I did it, what changes I have made comparing to others, and why I made these changes
- I need to show why others are not perfect and why mine fixed one or two problems
- I need to show the problems and applications of my work

In other words,

- let the readers know what's before it and what's after it
- let the readers understand what's it
- let the readers acknowledge the good and bad part of my research

What about figures and tables?

- label the figures and tables and use reference number to indicate the results I am explaining.
- numbers are already visible to my readers. I should explain the meaning of them to help the readers understand why I feel this is good or bad, using the words in the following subsections.

### Guide on structure

What are the two common errors in paragraphing?

- clusters of short or single-sentence paragraphs
- paragraphs that are too long

Generally, how to paragraph?

- A paragraph in academic writing often stars with a topic sentence, which gives the main idea of this paragraph. The other sentences are related to the main idea.
- When the idea moves too far way from the first sentence, start a new paragraph.

How to connect sentences?

- overlap, to repeat something from the previous sentence
- use a pronoun (it, they) or pro-form (this, these)
- use semicolon or a relative clause. Joining sentences with a semicolon works well when two sentences are very closely related and one of them is quite short
- use signalling sentence connector (therefore, however)

Any more tips?

- read the guide for authors of the journal if there is any
- write more about the key points in each section, for example, the main changes in the method, the most interesting result, the most beneficial application
- About the abstract, I can give one overview for the research map. Then the gap, the methodology, the results and the achievements. In the end add a direction for the future work.

### Guide on grammar

How to use different tenses?

|Tense|Usage|Format|Example|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|present simple|describe a general fact as I believe or with references |sth. do/does|the prediction error decreases as the particle number increases|
|past simple|describe a fact not generally accepted, or relevant to present|sth. did|He published the result in 1998.|
|present perfect|describe a fact happened in the past but relevant to present|sth has/have done|Little attention has been paid to the selection of variables.|

- if the procedure is normally done or standard, I can use the present simple tense
- to specifically indicate what I did, I should use the past simple tense, and adding phrases like *in this study* to distinguish my work from others that I cited before
- gap/problem is normally in the present simple tense
- referring to the paper itself is in the present simple tense
- referring to the methodology is in the past simple tense
- referring to the calculations is in the present simple tense
- results can be expressed in either the present simple tense, or in the past simple tense
- achievements can be expressed in the present perfect tense
- applications are normally states in the present simple tense
- mind the difference between modal verbs in different tenses and their negative

What's the rule of the use of 'a' and 'the'?

- singular countable nouns need a determiner, like *the*, *my*, *some*, *one*.
- the way I use a noun can determine whether it is countable or uncountable.
- use *the* if or when I and my reader both know which thing/person I mean, and *a* otherwise.
- use *the* if there is only one possible referent
- use *a* if it doesn't matter or I don't know or my reader doesn't know which thing/person I am referring to

### Guide on words

How to refer to myself or my group?

- use *we* to refer to my research group, not people in general; otherwise use *it is known that*.
- use passive instead of *we*, especially in the central report.
- use *this article/paper* instead of *I/we*

Any more tips?

- be careful when using many adverbs in a sentence and it can cause confusions
- there is often a space between the quantity/number and the SI symbol
- use words to achieve the "wow" feeling and avoid using exclamation marks.
- be kind when criticizing previous work and my work
- be generous when praising my work
- modify the sentences with modal verbs. but be careful with the tense
- I should think of the search phrases and keywords that people looking for my work might use, and then put them in the abstract.
- To use the acronym, first say what it means or stand for

|2.6|provide a brief overview of the key research projects in this area|group and order the literatures|
|2.7, 2.8|locate a gap in the research and describe the problem I will address|be respectful, and provide enough background information|
|3.8|describe the paper itself|present a prediction to be tested as the purpose|
|3.9|give details about the methodology reported in the paper|a few details would be enough|
|3.10|announce the findings|without many details|

### Methodology

|Sentence|Purpose|Notes|

|3.9|refine the implications of the results, including possible applications|In case there're none applications, I can clarify a theory.|
