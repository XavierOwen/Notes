# Writing the Abstract

## Structure

- a good title and abstract should attract readers
- the abstract should make sense as a standalone, self-contained description of the research article, and readers should be able to understand the key points and results of the research even if they never see the whole article
- read the guide for authors about this part
- I can try give one overview for the research map. Then the gap, the methodology, the results and the achievements. In the end add a direction for the future work.

## Grammar and Writing Skills

### Verb tense

- gap/problem is normally in the present simple tense
- referring to the paper itself is in the present simple tense
- referring to the methodology is in the past simple tense
- referring to the calculations is in the present simple tense
- results can be expressed in either the present simple tense, or in the past simple tense
- achievements can be expressed in the present perfect tense
- applications are normally states in the present simple tense

### Length

- 80-250 words in a single paragraph
- I can first write more, then gradually remove words that are not essential

### Language

- I should think of the search phrases and keywords that people looking for my work might use, and then put them in the abstract.
- To use the acronym, first say what it means or stand for

## Writing Task

Here is an example article. It's title is *physical properties of crude oil from acoustic measurements*, and below is its abstract. What is the purpose of each sentences?

|Sentence Number|Sentence|Purpose|Note|
|:-:|:-|:-|:-|
|1|The speed of sound in a fluid is determined by, and therefore an indicator of, the thermodynamic properties of that fluid. |to provide background factual information|Cite if necessary.|
|2|The aim of this study was to investigate the use of an ultrasonic cell to determine crude oil properties, in particular oil density. |to combine the method, the general aim and the specific aim of the study in one sentence|Combine sentences to shorten the total length.|
|3,4|An ultrasonic cell was constructed to measure the speed of sound and tested in a crude oil sample. The speed of sound was measured at temperatures between 260 and 411 K at pressures up to 75 MPs. |to summarize the methodology and provide details|Only the most important detail is included.|
|5|The measurements were shown to lead to an accurate determination of the bubble point of the oil. |to indicate the achievement of the study|Use positive language to emphasize new and importance achievement.|
|6|This indicates that there is a possibility of obtaining fluid density from sound speed measurements and suggests that it is possible to measure sound absorption with an ultrasonic cell to determine oil viscosity.|to present the implications of the study|The abstract should be consistent with what's reported in the paper. Use model verbs if needed.|
