> #Choice Supportive Bias
>
> People often make decisions by considering the advantages and disadvantages of each options. However, after a person selects an option, there is a tendency for that person to exhibit the choice-supportive bias. After selecting an option, a person may begin to favor that option. Without being fully aware of it, people who exhibit this bias tend to focus on and remember only the advantages of the option they selected. As time passes, they will overlook the option's disadvantages, eventually even forget them.

> Okay, so an example of this  from my own life. Five or six years ago, I was helping a friend of mine decide on a house to buy. He had been in the market to buy a house, and he had it narrowed down to this one house that he was interested in. What he really liked about this house was... it had an excellent location. It was in a great place. That was actually in the same part of the town where he was working, right up the street from his job - so he  wouldn't have far to drive to get to work, which he really liked. However, the downside of the house was that it was smaller than what he was hoping to buy. He had wanted to buy sort of a big house, and this house just wasn't that big. So, it was a tough decision, but my friend eventually did decide to buy the house. And a few years after he made the purchase, I remember, we were talking about the decision and why he decided to buy the house. He  told  me, well, of course, it was because of the house's location. He told me how happy he  was with the fact that it was so close to his work, how great it was that it was only a few minutes from his job. I said, yes, but what about its size-do you still think the house is kind of small? And he looked at me kind of surprised" Small? What do you mean, small?" -like he didn't know what I was talking about. The house's size, a couple of years after buying it, just didn't seem to be on his mind anymore.

> #Carrying Capacity
>
> An animal species needs to have enough resources, like food and water, to survive in any given environment.  However, because resources are limited, only a certain number of animals of a particular species are able to survive in a given habitat. The greatest number of a habitat can support is known as the carrying capacity. If nothing happens to disrupt or unbalance the relationship between the animal and its habitat, the carrying capacity will remain stable. However, a carrying capacity is not fixed. If there is a significant disruption, such as an environmental event that alters the amount of available resources in the habitat, the carrying capacity will change.

> Ok, so let's talk about what happened to a certain type of insect. A moth, a red and black moth that lives in Europe. These moths eat a plant called ragwort, and they live  in fields where the ragwort plants grow. Now there was a group of moths that lived in one of these fields... and for many years, there was a lot of ragworts growing there. So the moths had plenty to eat, and the total number of moths in the field stayed pretty much the same. But then one year it rained a lot less than usual, and the ragwort didn't grow as well. The result was that the moths didn't get enough to eat, and many didn't survive... But even the ones that did survive didn't lay as many eggs as before. So that year the moth population in the field was quite a bit smaller. The next year, though, the amount of rainfall returned to normal again. Many more ragwort plants grew, and once again there was a lot available for the moths to eat. So that year the moth population increased, and the female moths laid many more eggs than the year before. And now, after all that rainfall and plant growth, there were just as many moths in the ragwort fields as there were before.

> #The Familiarity Principle 
>
> People tend to develop a preference for things they have previously encountered, things they are familiar with. Social psychologists refer to this tendency as the familiarity principle. Given a choice between two similar items, one they have experienced before and another that is new, most people will choose the familiar item. This principle operates even when people are not conscious of their previous experience with an item. Once people have been exposed to an item—even if they do not recall having been exposed to it—they will tend to prefer that item over other items to which they have not been previously exposed.

> Some researchers did an experiment  related to this. What they did was, they assembled  a group of subjects, a group of students. And they showed these students a series of geometrical shapes. These were very distinctive shapes, a little unusual, not the kind of shapes the students often see. But they only showed the students the  shapes for a very short period of time, about a  second. They also lowered the light in the room to make it even more difficult for the students to see the shapes. So the shapes were therefor a  split seconds in dim light, and then they were gone. In the next step of the experiment, the researchers again showed the students some shapes... But this time, they gave the students a longer time to look at them. And this time, they showed the images in pairs - two at a time. In each pair, one shape was the shape the students had already seen for just a split second in dim light - and the other was some other shape that hadn't been shown to them before. After presenting each pair, the researchers asked the students  to say which of the two shapes they liked better. Most of the time, the students preferred the shape they 'd already seen earlier in the experiment. Now, if you asked them if they'd already seen that shape, they probably wouldn't know for sure. But that didn't matter, they still tended to prefer the shape they'd already seen.

> #Integrated Farming
>
> Many farmers keep animals and raise crops at the same time. While some farmers treat the cultivation of their animals and plants as two separate activities, others integrate the two so that they work together. This is called integrated farming. Integrated farming uses the natural behavior of animals in a way that helps to keep both animals and crops healthy and thriving. By integrating a particular animal with a specific crop, farmers create a system in which both animals and plants provide for each others’ needs.

> Okay, so an example of this is when chickens are used to prepare a field for planting. Famers who do this have a special kind of little house that they keep their chickens in. This little house has four walls and a roof, but it doesn't have any floor. And it has wheels attached to it, so it can easily be moved from one location to another. So, famers move this  little house to a field where something is going to be planted, say, bean plants... and then the chickens are placed inside the house. Now remember there's no floor in this house. And what the chickens do is,they walk around inside the house and peck at the soil and eat any weeds or wild plants that they find... And then, when the chickens' re done eating  the weeds at the location, the  famers move the house to the next section of the field, and again the chickens peck at the soil and eat the weeds. So the chickens get to eat lots of weeds, which are  good for them. Now, this activity's also good for the bean plants that'll be growing in the field... Because when the chickens eat the weeds, they are improving the quality of the soil. Thanks to the chickens, when the bean plants start to grow, there won't be any weeds there to compete with them for  crucial resources, like sunlight and water.

> #The  Suspension of Disbelief
>
> As members of an audience, we can best enjoy the performance of a play if we become emotionally involved with the events and characters on stage. But to do this, we need to forget that what we see on stage is only imaginary, and pretend instead—temporarily--that it is real. This ability to temporarily put aside, or suspend, our doubt and believe that the action of a play is real is called the suspension of disbelief. Suspending disbelief enables viewers to become more and more absorbed in the play as they watch the story develop, and to respond emotionally to the events and characters as if they were real.

> So, for  example, back when I was in college, one of my roommates, Richard, was in a play I went to see. And when he first walked out on stage, I have to admit, I was a little distracted. Richard was dressed up like an old man- I could tell that his hair was colored gray and he was pretending, you know, to be older, so he walked more slowly - the way an older person would. But at first I only saw him as my roommate dressed up to look like an older man. But then as the play went on, I began to think of him less as the guy I lived with and more as this older man who was a father... one who had worked very hard for his family... the family in the play. And in the play, the father gets sick, and so is out of work- which, you know, cause me to become a little sad. And because of the father's long illness, the  family was worried that they wouldn't have enough money to pay the bills. And this made me feel worried too. Well, in the end, what happened was the family all came together and everyone found jobs and started  working- they all pitched in to help in the time of crisis. So, the family gets by and pays their bills, and soon after, the father recovers from his illness. And this made me feel relieved, and even rather happy.

> #Communal Nutrition
>
> Some kinds of social insects live in large groups or colonies in which different members of the colony have different tasks to keep the colony running smoothly. Some members of the colony are responsible for providing appropriate food for the entire colony. These insects typically practice communal nutrition. They gather different kinds of food and bring it to the nest to be shared by all members of the colony. They instinctively adjust and regulate the food they provide to meet the particular nutritional needs of the different members of the colony at any given time.

> Okay, so  here's a good example of this among ants. Ants live together in these large nests, and certain ants, the forager ants, have a particular job to do- they go out each  day to look for food items, leaves, seeds,fruits... things like that, and then these ants bring them back to the nest so all the other ants  can eat them. Now the forager ants don't just bring back whatever they may happen to find, they bring back different kinds of food. For example, adult ants normally like to eat things that are rich in sugar because they need energy to  carry on other activities in the nest. So at a time when the colony is composed mostly of adult ants, the forager ants look for pieces of fruit and other sugar-rich items. They being these back to the nest for the adult ants to eat to get the energy they need. But there is a time of the year when baby ants are born. Now, the baby ants need a different kind of food. They need food that will help them grow into adults. So their food needs to be rich in protein. So now  the forager ants do  something different. They start to gather more food items that are rich in protein, like certain types of leaves, or mushrooms. This way the young ants get the protein they need to help them grow.

> #Phoresy
>
> Animals often have to move from place to place to obtain resources. Most animals do so using their own physical effort, but animals of certain species may not be able to transport themselves efficiently in order to access the resources they need. These animals may make use of another animal species to transport them, without causing any injury to the other species. This relationship is known as phoresy. Phoresy, which is a temporary relationship, benefits the passenger species and causes little or no harm to the species doing the transporting.

> So, here's a good example of this. Mites are very small insect-like creatures. Mites live in tropical climates and feed on nectar and pollen in flowers. But these tropical flowers don't last long, they wilt and fall off quickly, and so the mites need to find new flowers in order to get more nectar and pollen to eat. But the mites can't fly, and  they are so small that it'd take them a while and a lot of effort to climb down one flower, crawl to another one, and climb all the way up again. So how do they get to the next  flower? Well, there's a bird, the hummingbird... hummingbirds eat the nectar from the same flowers as the mites. So when a hummingbird comes around and sticks its beak into the flowers to get the nectar out... the mites quickly climb  onto the hummingbird. Well, as I mentioned, mites are pretty tiny, so the hummingbird isn't harmed in any way. And all they do is stick to the hummingbird. Since the hummingbird also goes from flower to  flower for nectar, it takes the mites along. Once the hummingbird gets to the next  flower, the mites climb off and eat some pollen and nectar there... on the  new flower. Without the hummingbird carrying them from one flower to another, the mites would find it much more difficult getting food.

> #Signaling
>
> Customers are often willing to pay higher prices for high-quality products; however, without specialized knowledge, it can be difficult to evaluate whether certain items are high quality. When customers are unsure whether an item is high quality, and worth the price, they are less likely to purchase it. This problem can be resolved through signaling. The seller of a product finds a way to signal, or demonstrate, to the buyer that the product is high quality. One common signaling strategy is to have a person or company that is not involved in the sale provide an objective, unbiased judgment about the quality of a product.

> So, okay, here's a good example. A friend of mine owns a small jewelry store where she sells jewelry. And the jewelry she sells- watches, rings, necklaces -is very expensive, thousands of dollars, because it's all real gold, real diamonds, and other precious gemstones. So of course, when customers come into her store... well, if they are considering spending that much money on a piece of jewelry, they want to make sure it's authentic, that the gold is real, that the gemstones are real and not just pieces of glass. But most customers don't actually know how to tell the difference on their own. SO in order to reassure her customers, what my friend did was, she had a jewelry expert come in and look at all the jewelry in her store. This expert had like twenty years of experience examining jewelry, so he knew a lot about it, and the expert examined all the precious gemstones and certified that they were authentic... real. And then my friend put up a sign in the store saying that all the jewelry in her store had been certified as authentic by an leading expert, so her customers would see this sign and know that all the jewelry in the store was real. And since the expert didn't work for my friend's store, it didn't matter to him if the jewelry got sold or not, so customers were likely to trust his opinion. The expert was therefore able to provide evidence that the jewelry was worth the high prices.

> #Agonistic Behavior
>
> Within certain animal species, conflicts sometimes arise over resources such as territory or food. To resolve these conflicts, two animals of the same species may engage in agonistic behavior. With this type of aggressive behavior, the animals participate in a physical competition that demonstrates which animal is more powerful. While each animal attempts to prove its strength in the competition, it typically does so without harming the other animal. Once the winner is established, that animal gains access to the desired resources, while the weaker animal surrenders and leaves the area.

> I knew some scientists who were observing snakes in the wild. And they witnessed an encounter of this sort between two rattlesnakes. As you may know, rattlesnakes eat various kinds of small animals that live underground, in burrows, in little holes in the ground. And what these scientists saw was these two rattlesnakes had found the same hole, and both wanted to eat whatever food was in that hole. So what happened was, the two rattlesnakes faced each other... and then they lifted their bodies into an upright position and made themselves as tall as possible, and then they started pushing each other, kind of wrestling with one  another, each snake trying to gain control of the other snake. And what's interesting is that, during all this pushing and shoving and maneuvering, neither snake ever tried to bite the other snake, neither snake ever tried to injure the other snake. So then, after this went on for a while, one of the snakes finally gained control of the other snake, pushed it to the ground and held it there. At this point, the snake that was on top could have easily bitten the other snake. But it didn't- instead, it just release the other snake, just let it go. The snake that had lost just slithered away... and the snake that had won went down into the hole to look for food.

> #Primacy Effect
>
> When people form opinions about a person or a situation, those opinions are likely to be based on first impressions, on an initial assessment of the person or situation. In other words, the opinions we have of people or situations tend to be based much more on the first information we learn about them than on information we learn later. This tendency is called the primacy effect. Researchers believe that the primacy effect occurs because after people have made an initial judgment, they tend to notice evidence that supports that judgment, and disregard or fail to notice evidence that contradicts it.

> Here's an example from my own life. Before I started teaching, I worked as a research assistant in a laboratory for a year. Well, during my very first week on the job, I made a suggestion to my boss on how we could improve the way we were running an experiment. MY suggestion was a good one: the experiment was successful, and we got great results. Anyway, that first week, because of that one experiment, my boss decided perhaps without even realizing it, he decided I was a great research assistant. And he never changed his mind. After that first week, I was okay, you know, average. I was a good worker, but I also made mistakes- everyone does. But whatever my boss introduced me to someone , he'd say: this is John, our star research assistant. But a coworker of mine, she wasn't as fortunate. Her first week at the lab, she made a big mistake and the lab lost some important data. We recovered the data, but it cost the lab time and money. Well, our boss concluded that  week that my coworker was unreliable... incompetent. And he continued to think that. But actually, after that week, she turned out to be a good research assistant, probably better than me. She made some other small mistakes, like I said, everyone does. But our boss thought of her as unreliable... cause he only noticed her mistakes.

> #Habituation
>
> Habituation is a form of learning that is quite common among animals. When an animal experiences a situation for the first time, particularly one it considers threatening, it may instinctively respond by running away or by warning other members of its community with alarm calls. Normally, it responds this way each time the situation occurs. However, if through continuous and prolonged exposure the animal learns that the situation is harmless, the behavior gradually diminishes. Ultimately, it will stop responding to the situation altogether. Thus, through habituation a natural or instinctive behavior gradually changes.

> Prairie dogs' re small animals you are likely to find on wild, relatively flat, grassy areas of land in North America. They tend to live together in large numbers now, generally these animals don't come into contact with human beings, but every now and then they do, so let's assume that some  prairie dogs happen to live in an area where human beings frequently come and go. Now, the first time the animals would see a human being, they'd instinctively react by making a sharp barking sound like a dog... and jumping up and down- essentially warning or alerting other prairie dogs that are nearby of this potential threat. Exactly the same way that they'd react if they came upon or were threatened by a snake or a hawk, an animal that preys on them. Their instinctive reaction would be one of fear. They'd keep an eye on the human beings until these scary, possibly threatening individuals are gone. And they're likely to react this way every time they see a human being. However, if people pass through this area day after day without threatening them or trying to harm them, well, it turns out that the prairie dogs will gradually stop barking and jumping up and down when they see a human being passing through the area. At some point they'd stop reacting to human as though they were a threat.

> #Population Changes
>
> Populations of living beings are constantly changing. The number of humans, animals, insects, or plants living in a given area can vary because of two kinds of factors: biotic and abiotic. Biotic factors are living factors that can influence the size of populations, such as predators or other species competing for food. Abiotic factors are nonliving things in the surrounding environment that can cause population changes, such as weather or sunlight. Biotic and abiotic factors cause continual changes in the number of individuals that make up a population of organisms.

> Imagine there's a group of mice living in a large field, and owls living nearby. Now, owls eat mice, so the number of mice there are at any given time depends upon the number of owls in the area... because the more owls there are, the more mice get eaten, right? Now imagine one year, there are more owls than usual. Since there are more owls in the area to eat the mice, what do you think will happen to the number of mice? As you can imagine, the number would drop... there'd be fewer mice. As far as the other factor... we can use rabbits to help understand  this one. Imagine a population of rabbits living in an area... These rabbits usually start having their young at the end of winter, after the cold winter weather is gone, and they keep reproducing until the following winter, when they will stop again while the cold winter weather lasts. But let's say this year, the winter season is very short... and it, you know, starts getting warm much earlier than usual. Since winter this year is so short, the rabbits can start reproducing much earlier. That means the rabbits in that area will have at least one extra reproductive cycle, so, of course, one extra litter of baby rabbits. So the number of rabbits in that area would increase a lot.

> Businesses that perform services or carry out projects for clients generally come to an agreement with their clients about the extent or scope of a project before beginning the project. However, as a project progresses, clients may ask for more than the business originally expected to provide, and the scope of the project may grow larger than intended. This phenomenon is known as scope creep, and it can cause conflict between businesses and their clients. Scope creep is especially common when the terms or conditions of the initial agreement are not clearly defined, and a client may expect more than the business had planned to provide.

So recently this woman hired him to build a fence around her yard. She said she wanted a wooden fence running all the way around her backyard. She and my friend quickly settled on a price on this job. They basically just made a verbal agreement about the work that would be done without putting any of the agreement in writing. And so  my friend got to work building the fence. So when my friend was almost finished building the fence around the woman's yard, the woman told  my friend that she wanted the fence painted white. My friend was surprised by this, because he did not think that he had been hired to also paint the fence. He told the woman this that he had just been hired to build the fence, not paint it. But the woman said she thought  when she hired him to build the fence that this also meant the fence would be  painted. They ended up arguing and eventually my friend finally agreed to paint the fence without charging extra, just to be nice. But he wasn't happy about it.

> Special techniques, or memory devices, are often used to help us recall information. One technique, the method of loci (i.e., method of location), is particularly helpful for remembering several pieces of information in a particular order. To use this technique, we first imagine a familiar place such as a building or an outdoor area. This familiar place should have a series of landmarks or locations within it that we can imagine walking past in a predictable, logical order. Once the landmarks have been identified in a given order, we assign one piece of the information that we want to later recall to each location. The information should be assigned in the order in which we want to remember it. To later recall the new information in order, we imagine walking through the familiar place, recalling what is stored at each location along the way.

> So how would this work? Well, let's say you need to learn the names of the planets in order, by distance from the Sun. So first, think about the landmarks you pass as you walk from, say, your dormitory to the student center. The first one might be the front door of your dormitory, then the big tree in front of the dorm, the next landmark you pass might be the  statue in front of the library, next, the steps to the  science  building, you get the idea. You memorize the major points along the walk, imagining yourself going from the first landmark, to the second, the third, and so on. Now the next thing you do is assign one planet to each of your landmarks in sequence. Since Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, you assign it to the first landmark- the front door of your dorm. The next planet, Venus, to the tree in front of the dorm, the third planet, Earth, you assign to the third landmark, the statue in front of the library and so on and so on. And each time you picture the association in your mind as vividly as possible. Then later... say you're sitting in the classroom taking a test and you have to write the order of the planets from the Sun. What do you do? You imagine yourself on that familiar walk to the student center, passing each landmark as usual, when you think about walking out the door of your dorm, you're reminded of Mercury. When you see the beautiful tree in front of the dorm, you think of Venus... at each landmark along the way, you recall the next planet and write it down.

> #Warning Coloration
>
> Many animals have defense mechanisms that help protect them from predators. In some cases, these animals have distinct coloring that signals predators of the presence of such defenses. This type of coloring is called warning coloration. If a predator does not recognize the meaning of this coloration and attacks, it may suffer significant discomfort or injury when its would-be prey employs its defense mechanism. As a result, the predator learns to associate the warning coloration with negative consequences, and will from that point forward avoid attacking animals that have that coloration.

> We have a good example of this with the skunk. As most of you know, the skunk is a furry little mammal that can be found throughout North America. Skunks have a very distinctive marking. Their body is mostly black, and they have a big white stripe that runs from the top of their head, all the way down their back, and along their big, bushy tail. So they are very easy to see and very easy to recognize even from a distance. Skunks also have special glands under their tail that produce a terrible-smelling liquid. And when skunks are approached by a predator, they lift their tail and spray the predator with this liquid. For example, let's say a wolf is preparing to attack a skunk. As the wolf approaches, the skunk lifts its tail and sprays the wolf. That's very very unpleasant for the wolf because it's now covered with this repulsive, foul-smelling liquid. The wolf doesn't want to be sprayed again, so it backs off and leaves the skunk alone. And from then on, whenever that wolf sees a furry little black body, with a big white stripe running from its  head to its tail, it'll recall that terrible smell, and it'll be sure to stay far away.

> People of all ages generally prefer to have as much freedom as possible in determining their behavior. When individuals feel that their actions are being unfairly limited, they often attempt to restore freedom by directly contradicting or opposing the rule of regulation that threatened their freedom. Both children and adults demonstrate behaviors that are the results of their urge to restore freedom. This reaction, termed “reactance” by psychologists, come from an individual's desire to reestablish freedom and control of a situation.

Now imagine that one day, for no apparent reason, your parents decide that they don't want you playing there anymore. You're not allowed to go there anymore. Of course, you are not gonna like that one bit. It's not fair! And now that you're not allowed, you want to play there even more than before. So you sneak over there anyway. You go to this playground despite your parents' rules. Here's another example. There was a town that passed a law that banned the sale of a certain kind of soap. There was an ingredient in this soap that was harmful for the environment, so stores weren't  allowed to sell the soap anymore. Keep in mind that this ingredient had no effect  whatsoever on this soap's ability to clean things. None. But, people found out about the upcoming restriction and got upset. They thought they  should be able to buy whatever soap they wanted. It wasn't right to take this soap away. And a week before the law went into effect, what happened? People went and bought a whole lot of this particular soap. Way more than they would have in another circumstance.

> #Optimal Foraging
>
> Food provides animals with the energy they need to survive. However, animals also lose energy in the process of obtaining, or foraging, for food. Therefore, in order to conserve energy, many animals behave in ways that minimize the energy they expend in the foraging process while at the same time maximizing their nutritional benefits. This energy-efficient approach to obtaining food is known as optimal foraging. The practice of optimal foraging allows animals to expend the least possible amount of energy while at the same time obtaining prey with high food value that will provide them with necessary nutrients.

> All right, so I've got a good example of this. There's a bird, a species of crow, that lives  near the water, and it feeds on a type of shellfish that has a hard outer shell. In order to eat the shellfish, the bird has to crack open its hard shell. So, when this bird feeds, what it does is it dives down out of the air into shallow water, grabs a shellfish in its  mouth, then carries the shellfish up in the air. It then drops the shellfish, lets it fall onto the rocks below. When the shellfish hits the rocks, its shell cracks and splits open, and the bird can eat it. Now this bird, this crow, doesn't just swoop down, grab the first shellfish it sees, then fly up to any height and let it fall. Instead, it does two things. first, it carefully selects only the biggest shellfish, that means it's going to get the biggest possible meal for its efforts. Second, it carries the shellfish up to a specific height, about five meters, and drops it from there. If the bird dropped the shellfish from the lower height, it would have  to pick it up and drop it too many times in order to  break the shell. On the other hand, if the bird carried the shellfish into a higher altitude, an altitude that is necessary to crack the shell, it'd be wasting energy. So this bird expends just the  right amount of energy- no more, no less- that it needs to obtain just the right kind of food.

> The memories people form when they learn names and facts are different from the memories they form when they learn how to perform a task.These memories of performing particular actions are called procedural memories. Procedural memories are memories of the process of performing a task that become automatic with practice. Once a task has been practiced, or repeated many times, procedural memories are established.These procedural memories allow people to perform the action automatically and to recall it relatively easily many years later.

> I've experienced this kind of thing myself. When I was a boy, I took guitar lessons, and my first lessons, my guitar teacher, she showed me how to hold the guitar and how to place my fingers on the strings. Every day when I got home, I would play the guitar for hours, and after a couple years spending time like this playing at home. I could just pick up my guitar and play music without thinking about it. But after college, I stopped playing and for years I never played or even picked up a guitar. Then, the other day,I found my old guitar. I was amazed to discover that when I picked it up I knew hoe to play even though I hadn't played in years. I just picked it up and right away, I found that I still knew where to press my fingers to play the right notes. Now, I couldn't explain to you exactly how I was moving each finger or exactly why I had to press the string at one point and not another. But I could still play my favorite songs.

> #State-dependent Memory
>
> When learning something new, people are aware (consciously or unconsciously) of the environment in which their learning takes place. This learning environment includes the physical setting, the time of day, and even the people who are present during learning. Studies have shown that when people later need to remember information they have learned, their ability to do so is affected by their current environment. If the environment is the same or similar to the original learning environment, recall—the ability to remember—will be easier and more successful. Psychologists refer to this as state-dependent memory.

> When I was a student in middle  school, some of my classmates and  I get an assignment to do a group presentation on tropical plants. OK, and as part of this assignment we needed to memorize the names... you know... and certain key characteristics of the plants. Then, on the morning the assignment was given, our teacher gave us time to work on the presentation during class- right there in the classroom. So there we were, during the school day, in our usual classroom, studying and memorizing the information...  and our teacher and the other kids in the class were all there, too. OK, so then later, on the night before the presentation, I invited my group members over to my house to do some final studying. And there we were... it was after dark, my parents and my brother were in the next room watching TV and no one else was around. It felt pretty different from working in the classroom with all our schoolmates around, like it was on that morning when we'd spent time learning the information. Anyway, at my house, when we tried to remember the plant information, we got a little worried - suddenly it was more difficult to remember all the names and different facts. But the next morning when we were back into the classroom, the presentation actually went very smoothly- it was easier for us to remember what we needed to talk about.
