下面看答案，有模板的

**The Instructor** announced that **all students** are required to visit a **History Museum** where an **(Ancient) Egyptian Sculpture Exhibition** is hold, and to write a paper on what pieces impress you the deepest and why. The students who registered in the course are free to go.

**The woman in the conversation thinks it is a good idea.** **She gave two reasons for that**.

She **first said** that to learn more you need more than book, which is not very exciting. A visit to what you've learned in class would be better and it makes you never forget.

She **then mentioned** that she always wanted to visit that exhibition since it opened. But the twenty-dollar ticket stopped her since she never had the money. And she don't mind writing the paper given the chance to visit.



### Task 4

先45s阅读一段巨长😵的**名词解释**。然后听教授**举例子**解释名词概念。准备30s，答题60s。



#### 阅读部分

> <center>Audience Profile</center>
>
> **An Audience Profile** is a necessary first step in successful advertising. One might call it advertising's "homework". **It helps identify who exactly buys a given company's product as well as the type of people viewing this or that broadcast**. Before advertising, the information such as potential customers' preference and demand are gathered and analyzed in order to make advertisements aiming at their personal preferences and needs. With this information at hand, companies can then create ads appealing to people likely to buy their products.
>
> **:arrow_right: Title: An audience profile**
>
> **➡️ Definition: helps identify who buys a given company's products and the type of people viewing this or that broadcast.**



到时候就说：

**The reading material is about a concept of audience profile, which helps identify who exactly buys a given company's products and the type of people viewing this or that broadcast**. 

如果45s内没有把这个抄下来，就说

**The reading material is about an academic concept called audience profile,**

接下来，说

**And the professor explains this by giving an example in lecture.**



#### 听力部分

> OK, we've been looking at the definition of an audience profile. That's all fine, but it's pretty general. **To make the idea come alive, let's *take an example* of a company that sells milk**.
>
> **:arrow_right: e.g. milk company**
>
> A few years back, the sales of the milk company were only so-so. So they took a **survey to see just who was buying their milk. Or how often and how much the customers buy their milk**.
>
> **:arrow_right: so-so, survey, who/how often/how much**
>
> Then the company found most of its primary customers are females, especially those with children. It makes a lot of sense to everybody since men usually buy beer for themselves and martinis for single women. So it's women with kids who buy the milk. And also the survey showed that these female buyers focus more on nutrition, not on the taste of the milk when choosing among different milk products.
>
> **:arrow_right: female with kids, nutrition rather than taste**
>
> **So the milk company started running those ads with a silver-haired Doctor telling those worried looking mothers how the nutritious and healthy milk produced by the company can benefit children's physical well being.**
>
> **:arrow_right: old Doctor, worried moms, good for their kids**
>
> **Later, the company has become Number One in the milk market ever since.**
>
> **➡️ becomes the top in the milk market**
>
> So remember, before you even dare to think about writing that ad, find out two things. Who is likely to buy your product? and what is she worried about? Answer those questions, and you have a winning ad!
>
> 问题长这样
>
> Use the example from the lecture, explain how the milk company uses the Audience Profile to promote its sales.



最后看答案吧，也是有模板的。

**The reading is about an academic concept called *Audience Profile***. It helps companies identify exactly who buy their products and who view this or that broadcast. After analyzing, companies can make ads more targeted.

Then in the lecture the professor showed how using the example of a milk company.

At the beginning the selling was at average level, then they surveyed their customers and found that the major were female with kids who care about nutrition rather than taste. So later the ads were changed with an old doctor showing worried mothers how beneficial their milk is to their children and eventually the company has become the top one in the milk market.



### Task 5

#### 听力

> W- What's your plan for **Spring Break** (**:arrow_right: Spring Break**), Josh?
>
> M- I'd like to go home but, you know, it's so far from school (**:arrow_right: home, far**). So I thought I'd just stay in the dorm and write that history term paper I still have to get done (**➡️ stay dorm, write term paper**).
>
> W- Didn't you hear? The dorms are closed for Spring Break! (**➡️ ❌ dorm closed**)
>
> M- Yeah, tell me about it. I don't know what to do.
>
> W- Why not stay with your buddy Nick? His family lives only about fifteen minutes away by car. You could stay with his family during vacation. (**:arrow_right: 1. Nick, buddy, near**)
>
> M- I thought of that, but that's the problem. Nick is my best buddy. I probably wouldn't have any time to do the paper. Plus, Nick will go for a trip with his family. And he will definitely want me to come along. (**➡️ ❌ best, no time, trip, come along**)
>
> W- Couldn't you just take a trip and work really hard after coming back? This way you won't need to worry about your living arrangement.
>
> M- I could, but I worried there wouldn't be time to do the paper. I only have a few days to get my paper done after coming back from the trip with Nick. (**➡️ ❌ few days, no time for paper**)
>
> W- Yeah, the time would be too tight.
>
> M- Hey! Wait a minute: I just had an idea!
>
> W- What is it?
>
> M- My professor is going to Italy for holiday, and I heard he needs someone to house-sit and feed his dog. I could probably stay there and work on my paper. (**➡️ 2. pro, house-sit, dog, paper**)
>
> W- That's perfect!
>
> ​M- Umm, no wait. I'd be there all by myself. And his house is pretty far from town. Without a car, it would be really hard to go somewhere else. (**➡️ :wavy_dash: far from town, hard to go other places without a car**)
>
> W- That's a problem.
>
> 再看问题
>
> The speaking discusses two possible solutions to the man's problem. Describe the problem and the two solutions. Then state which of the two solutions you prefer and explain why.



####答案与模板

**The man is facing the problem** that he was planning to stay in the dorm and work on his history term paper however the dorm will be shut during the **Spring Break**.

**The woman first suggest that** he could possibly stay with his buddy Nick. And after some discussion **he come up with his own solution that** he could stay in his professor's house to house-sit and take care the dogs while the professor is at holiday.

**The two approaches have their own shortcomings**. However, apparently, **his own solution is better and I am for it**. As he admits, there'll no enough time to finish his paper if he stays with Nick and goes to trip with him. While if he chooses to stay in his professor's house. Time will be sufficient and all the inconveniences are the house-sit job, feeding the dog, and no cars to go to other places.



### Task 6

听一段上课内容，首先是**概念或现象的解释**，然后是**例子阐释**，一般两个。重点是例子。20s准备，60s回答。



#### 听力

> I'd like to say a few words about **how a site is chosen for an observatory**.
>
> (**:arrow_right: choose site, observatory**)
>
> True, the question doesn't seem exciting, but in fact its answer has a lot of importance for our research as astronomers. Really, there are only **two main factors** to take into account.
>
> **The first factor** has to do with **humidity**. Is the air dry? Wet air is not good for an observatory because the tiny water droplets in the air tent to make what we see through the telescope a blur. Plus, these water droplets can carry dust, making the image seen even more blurry.
>
> (**:arrow_right: 1. humidity ❌, water drop, blur; with dust, more blurry**)
>
> For this reason, most observatories are located in the desert, preferably at high elevation. The air there is dry and the higher you go, the less water the air carries. Right now, there is an observatory being built at Atacama in Chile's desert. The site is nearly 5,000 meters above sea level. So the view should be wonderful.
>
> (**➡️ desert, altitude, dry air; one at Chile's desert, 5000**)
>
> **The second factor** has to do with **light pollution**. Is anyone here from a farm? Did you ever notice how, in the city, you can see so very few stars? But in the country, the sky just blooms with stars!
>
> (**:arrow_right: 2. light pollute ❌, city few stars, country, many stars**)
>
> The reason is the bright lights of the big city interferes with a huge telescope even more than it does with our human eyes. After all, telescopes gather light and make it more intense. So an observatory must be located well away from the cities.
>
> (**:arrow_right: light interfere, :telescope: gather light, more intense; far away from cities**)
>
> 再看问题
>
> Using points and examples from the talk, explain the two factors of choosing a site to build an observatory.



####答案与模板

**In the lecture, the professor talks about** two factors that are crucial when choosing a site to build an observatory.

**The first factor** has something to do with **humidity**. The water in the air will blur the scene in the telescope. Further, the dust in the water drop will make the image more blurry. Thus most observatories are located in desert, and higher altitude for the dry air. One can be seen in Chile's desert with five thousands meters above the sea level.

**Another** is the **light pollution**. Similar to the reason why we see few stars in city and many stars in country, the light will largely interfere the telescope since it gathers light. So it's a must that we locate the observatory far away from the cities.
