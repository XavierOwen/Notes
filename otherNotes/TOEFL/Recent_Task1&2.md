# Summary of TOEFL speaking task 1 & 2﻿

Xavier

## 那天最新讲解

最优答题逻辑是：一段素材，所有题目。托福不是考知识面的，而是考基于普通逻辑语言能力测试的。

18、19年的考试已经变难了。先举例说个大误区：

> Choose a place that you go to often and explain why this place is important to you.

这是OG里的，有的人因此就按照话题把口语题目分类，但是，这个题的重点是**important**！比方说要去见谁，做什么事，place本身不是重点。

考的是why important。

最新托福趋势里，有一个最常见的题目：某学校is planning to do sth，问你的想法建议。

老师这里说有四个，但是只说了一个，那么我猜剩下的可能有：你的朋友is planning to do sth，问你的想法建议；后面自己又说了一个：三选一。

素材，之所以万能，是因为能体现完整的破题逻辑。一个万能素材的基本要素要有

1. 人: Steve Jobs
2. 地方: Silicon Valley
3. 物件: iPad
4. 事情: Apple Company
5. 普适性优点: enhance efficiency of learning, entertainment

> 大学打算做3个项目，觉得哪个好？
>
> - Make more accurate predictions about weather
> - Clean rivers and oceans
> - Explore outer space

这里用那天老师的做法，这三个方面你怎么说？都不了解不是？不然天文专业来考啊，环境专业来考啊，不是不公平吗？

Explore outer space, contributes to higher **creativity** and **imagination, passion** and **further encourage** students to **explore**.

Steve Jobs, before founding the famous company, has taken a similar project and I believe that's crucial for his future success.

几点要注意的

- 考的不是你的知识面！不回答，只能是语言问题。
- 题目不是在问事实！没人知道乔布斯是不是真的搞了这个project，也没有人要求你去证实。你自己要自圆其说就好。
- 你的主张的优点（理由），一定要说。



> 你觉得交朋友都是一个年龄的好，还是不同年龄的好？

Friends of similar age tends to have more intense interaction and collisions of mind, which would foster more passion and ideas.

Steve Jobs is one who have many friends of his age and accordingly, he has obtained great creativity and teamwork spirit. I believe that's crucial for his future success.

I want to become a person like him and that's why I made this choice.

### 1/3 选课

>Which course would  you like to take?
>
>- photography
>- public speech
>- business
>
>Explain why. Includes reasons and details to support your response.

**Personally**, I would be more interested in a business class **on account of the following reasons.** 

**Primarily**, I think that in this day and age, looking for gainful emplooyment is becoming more and more difficult and it's always been better to be a job creator rather than a job seeker and  so knowing a little bit about business and how to start a successful one  would be a useful skill. 

**In addition to that**, having a good knowledge in the business sector is very helpful because it's a transferrable skill. You can take whatever you've learned and apply it to almost anything. Unlike some skills that you might not be able to use in any other field. business skills are needed in every field.



### 1/2 家长帮孩子解决问题

> Some people believe  that parents should help their children tosolve problems, other people believe that  parents  should encourage their children to solve problems by themselves. Which one do you agree with and why?

**Personally**, I think it's better for parents to encourage their children to solve problems on their own **on account of the following reasons.**

**Primarily**, it teaches them to become more independent. When a child is able to figure out how to get out of some sort of trouble, it gives them a sense  of achievement, a sense of satisfaction. 

**Plus**, it allows parents to have free time. Nobody wants to spend their whole life sorting out other people's problems even their children's. If a situation gets out of hand, it's natural for a parent to offer some assistance but it's just better for everyone if they don't  always have to.



## 10.20

### 祝贺朋友成绩

> If your frend has just achieved something remarkable, say, winning  a prize in a competition or finding a new job, how are you going to celebrate this  accomplishment with him? 

Personally, celebrating big milestones in one's life is exremely important to me. If I had to celebrate a friend's achievement, I'd probably do it with a small dinner with close friends and family. I think the best way to recognize accomplishment is by sharing the moment with those closest to you, people that genuinely care about how far you go in life, people that can congratulate and salute you and really mean it. I also think this world would be a great way to acknowledge the fulfillment of a goal coz it's more intimate. It'd give enough time to eat, drink and toast and I'm convinced that everyone involved  would walk away feeling like they enjoyed the evening.



### 同意：大学关闭机房

> The university is considering closing the computer lab on campus, since students already have their own laptops.

**Personally**, I think it's a terrible idea to close the computer lab on campus **on account of the  foollowing reasons.**

**Primarily**, this decision is under the assumption that every student has a  laptop. However, there might be certain circumtances in which a student needs to use the lab, for instance, if  their laptop is lost or being repaired. If an alternative isn't  provided by the university, students would always have an excuse to hand in a paper or any other assignment  late. 

**Plus**, the  computer lab isn't just a place to  use a computer. It offers a more conducive environment for students to catch up on their studies. It's quiet and there's always a fast  internet connection, which is just what every student needs to study efficiently.



## 10.14

### 优缺点：家族企业

> Talk  about one advantage <u>**and**</u> one disadvantage of running a family business with your family members.

**As far as I'm concerned**, getting into business with family members can **have pros and cons**.  **In regards to the pros,** there's more loyalty in working with family members because everyone has one shared goal and everyone puts in the effort to ensure the business become a success. So working long hours and putting up  with a lot of other problems within the enterprise isn't as bad if everyone involved is rooting for the company.

**As far as the cons go,** it's common for family members to give each other opportunities  regardless of their inadequacies. Therefore even if one is not entirely capable of doing the job, he or she would be the preferred candidate for a position, and this ultimately leads to poor performance.



### 同意：团体运动利于孩子成长

> Do you agree or disagree  with the following statement?
>
> Attending organized team sports can help children to be more socially developed.

**Personally, I completely agree with the opinion that** participating  in group sports helps children become more socially developed. 

**Primarily**, it's easy for kids to get along with family, but outside the home, it's tough to cooperate with other people, so this teaches them how to be more accepting of different personalities and helps them develop a higher tolerance for other individuals they don't know very well.

**Plus**, it's also a great idea coz children need to learn how to make friends in a early age. They learn how to start up conservations, how to learn and become more sociable. And these interpersonal skills are transferrable in the real world when they get older. So team sports are critical in a child's social development.



## 10.13

### 1/3 报纸新增

> Our school newspaper  is planning to add a column. Which type of information do you think that  students will be interested in?
>
> - restaurant reviews
> - travel tips and advice
> - film recommendation

**Personally**, **I would  recommend** the school newspaper add a column about travel tips and advice for students **on account of the following reasons**.

**Primarily**, it's  very likely that most students are not familiar with their school surroundings and give their advice about where to go sightseeing like museums and tourist spots would be very useful.

**Plus**, travelling tips and  advice might be the one thing that would be difficult to find credible information about on their own. The internet has made it easier to find nearby restaurants and  film recommendations but finding detailed travel tips, and trustworthy advice is still difficult to do. So it's very valuable information for students to have.



### 1/2 应对问题方式

> When meeting problems in your daily life, would you like to solve it in a serious way or in a humorous way? Give your explanations in your response.

**Personally**, I would  <u>tackle</u> problems with a little humor **on account of the following reasons**.

**Primarily**,  laughing about the issue helps to keep me calm and that's also keeps me  a little <u>level headed</u> so it's easier for me to think clearly. If I'm too serious about it right away, I'd probably panic and make the situation even worse.

**Plus**, I also feel that it's much easier on other people around me if they see me calm, cool and <u>collected</u>. And I think they'd be more willing to  give me advice or make some sort of suggestion coz talking to someone that's dealing with a problem with jokes makes them a lot more approachable. So, I think it's always better to laugh at your dilemma before trying to fix it.



## 9.16

### 1/2  Exam&Movie

> You have just received a message that your professor has canceled the class on this evening. Your classmate asks you to go for a movie at an unexpected time tonight, but you need to take an exam in two days. What are you going to do on this evening and why?

**Personally speaking**, I would choose to go see the movie **on account of the following reasons**.

**Primarily**, a movie night is a well-deserved intermission after studying for a long period of time. The reinforcement puts me in a better mood and wards off the depression and pessimism, which would prepare ourselves better to face the challenges and difficulties tomorrow.

**Plus**, watching movies sometimes break the monotony of daily routine, enrich our dreary study life and cultivate our recreation and imagination, which have lots of benefits on our mental health and further development. 



### 同意：homeschooling

> Nowadays, many people choose homeschooling, meaning that they invite private teachers to their homes to teach them. Do you think homeschooling is a good idea? Why?

Personally, I think homeschooling is a terrific idea **on account of the following reasons**.

**Primarily**, a lot of people find the curriculum of schools today unsatisfactory. They don't like how their kids are being taught. So, it makes sense for a parent, to buy their own credible course materials and have their kids taught at home. That way it's cheaper and you know where your child is and what they're being taught.

**Plus**, there are lots of unsafe factors outside. No matter in school or on the way to school. Take America as an example, nowadays with all the school shootings happening in American campus, it is a wise move to home school your children coz at least you know they'b be safe.









## 9.9

### 1/3 选择员工

> Which of the following is the most important for recruitment of new employee?
>
> - academic background
> - work experience
> - interview performance
>

Edited answer:

**Among the three, my natural inclination is** the academic background, **on account of the following reasons.**

**Primarily speaking**, there are so many people, especially those who just graduated from colleges, do not have any working experience. **Accordingly**, it'd quite unfair to consider the past working experience as a deciding element for recruitment. Most of them may have terrific specialized skills but have little experience at all. In that case, only through academic background can we predict how well the new employee, especially for the fresh graduates, would fit the job.

**Plus**, academic background also reflects plentiful information. Compared with interview  performance, it does not take much randomness into consideration. Thus, academic background is more  reasonable than two other criteria to be the most important thing for recruitment.



### 1/2 装修

> Do you like to decorate your room with objects like
>
> - paintings and pictures
> - leave the wall blank and simple

I'd love to decorate my room with **Steve Jobs**' posters since I admire him the most.



## 9.8

### 建议：做菜

> 朋友要学做菜有啥建议

1.learn from relevant books and video materials

2.get aid from the Internet, such as  Google search, Bing search

3.be aware of not being hurt by dangerous things in the kitchen, such as superhot dishes, spoiled oils, sharp knifes and so on.



### 同意：旅游告知亲戚

> 在外地旅游要不要让朋友和亲戚随时知道自己在哪里在干什么

 From my personal perspective, my answer is positive.

Primarily, keep in touch with  you parents and close friends can ensure your safety when coming across some emergency. Such as your mobile phone run out of charge, you lose your wallet somewhere or something like that.

Plus, share your happiness with your families and friends, let them know what you see and hear in your trip can also help you develop healthy intimate relationships. Take one of my friends Xavier as an example,  he loves sharing his seeing and thinking into WeChat moments, which helps him earn many friends with common interests to talk to.



## 9.2

### 1/3 大学项目

> 大学打算做3个项目，觉得哪个好？
>
> - Make more accurate predictions about weather
> - Clean rivers and oceans
> - Explore outer space

Clean river and  oceans. 

1. put our knowledge into practice, help solving the water  pollution problems.
2. have a profound influence on sustainable development of society and economy.

## 8.26

### 优缺点：老生给新生上课

> Your university is planning to ask upper-grade students to give the first year students an extra pre-course to teach them time management skills. What is the one advantage **<u>and</u>** one disadvantage of this program? Include reasons and details in your response.

**As far as I'm concerned**, the extra pre-course program **can have pros and cons**. **In regards of pros**, upper-grade students are peers for the freshmen in some degree, which really matters since they can give them instructions and suggestions from a similar stance without gap. 

**As far as the cons go**, upper-grade students usually have less experience and comprehension about the  management of time compared to the instructors who are majored in this field. They may give the freshmen some incorrect instructions or mislead them.



### 1/2 工作

> 选择有规律的工作时间还是更自由地在家工作。 

**Personally, my inclination is** working at home **on account of the following reasons**.

**Primarily,** I could save a lot of time from transportation. Take me as an example, during the time when I participated in a summer internship, I woke up early in the morning and spent over an hour on my way to the office. Most of the time  is wasted in the morning rush, which is tiring and meaningless.

**Plus**, it's very pleased to schedule my time according to my preferences. In this way, I could prevent work from encroaching my daily routine on exercises and entertainments, and from leading my life into an unhealthy, sedentary style. Ultimately,  I would dominate my own life as I want, which I firmly believe would benefit me, physically as well as mentally.

### 1/3 国家文化

> 当你要了解别国文化，你要做什么 
>
> - read books about foreign culture
> - watch films and videos
> - communicate online

老师答案：

Well among the three, I would definitely choose to watch films or videos online.

I have many friends from Michigan, lowa and Ohio State, so American football is always on the table when we hang out. So to know how to enjoy, say, the Super Ball and regular NFL or NCAA matches with them.

I shall know something about it. The best way, would be watching videos like "American football 101" on YouTube.

I man these videos help me learn the rules, the roles and the hotspot for the game faster. So when they cheer for a touchdown or a tackle, I could go with them instead of standing their like a noob.

So films and videos it is. By the way, go buckeyes!



### 同意：迟交作业

> class assignment that handed in after deadline should receive lower grades

老师答案

I definitely agree that students who hand in their assignments after the due should receive lower grades.

First, this is about a good sense of time management. People who delay for work often tends to procrastinate on their project. The lack of planning and execution always lead to a poor time schedule. Whom can they blame, anyway? Themselves I guess.

Also, this is about being fair to everyone who works on the project. Many people argue that they delay since they want their work to be "perfect", but if given more time, their fellow students' work would be even better, right?

So to be fair to other students, the best choice should be lowering those who delay for the assignment then.
