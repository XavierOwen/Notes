Xavier

## Intro

45s/30s/60s

- Explain **why** sb agree/disagree with the material
- Briefly **summarize** the proposal. Then **state** sb's opinion about the proposal and **explain** the reasons sb gives for holding that opinion.
- Explain **why** blah **made the decision** and **why** sb agree/disagree with it.



### Guide

For the decision, or proposal in the reading material:

- Person: see if there's a **signature**. If true, write it down; if not, find out the executor or the enforcer, maybe a university, or a resident committee.
- Time: if available
- Whatever it is, it is **proposed**.
- Combine the reading material and listening material!



### Template

**In the letter**/**announcement**, **we see that** somebody/some organization **proposed** that blah. **For one thing**, blah; **for another thing**, blah.

**In the conversation**, the man/woman **is (not) on board with** somebody/some organization, **on account of the following reasons**. **OK, from his/her point of view**, **firstly**, blah, **so**, blah; **secondly**, blah, **thus, right on the contrary to what's been said in the proposal**, blah.

(**These are the reasons why** *he/she* **(disagree) agree with that proposal.**)

<center>Response to the Plan for an Additional Lighting System</center>

I *oppose* the university **plan** to purchase an *additional* outdoor **lighting system**. The university says it would make our historic campus more *attractive* by **illuminating out buildings at night**. However, the university would spend an extra of \$**1000 per month** for *electricity*. Instead, I recommend the money be used to complete the **library renovation project** as quickly as possible.

That's not the only *reason* we shouldn't get the new system. These powerful lights would **brighten the sky** as well as the buildings and *seriously interfere* with the use of our **astronomy equipment**. Our **academic mission** must come first – and the practice of astronomy is done *best* when the sky is **darkest**.

—R. N. Heinrich, Professor of Astronomy

### Listening Material

*M*-I total *agree* with the letter.

W-How come? Don't you think the campus looked pretty at night?

M-Well, it might make the buildings look nice at bight but why should we *waste* so much money on something we really don't need? Just for looks, there're more important things than that.

W-I can see your point.

M-I mean how *long* has that **library project** been going on?

W-Yeah, the whole third floor has been **closed** for the **last few months**.

M-Exactly. And just last night, I had my astronomy class with professor *Henrik*. He told us something that was totally *disappointing*. We've been **tracking a comet** *all semester* long and he says if the university's *plan* goes through, we won't be able to **see** the comet **through telescopes** anymore.

W-That's so sad. You chose the school just *because* of the **astronomy program**, didn't you?

M-Yeah, it's such a good program. But if it's *too* **bright** around here at night, we'll *have* to go back to **looking at the pictures** of comets in the **textbook**. You could tell Professor Henrik is **disappointed** too. It's the **hands-on experience** that gets everyone all *excited*.

> **Explain** why the man agrees with the professor's opinion.
>
> **In the letter**, **the professor Henrik** is **against** the plan to buy additional lighting system. **For one thing**, it requires one thousand dollars per month for electricity which should be used for the library renovation project; **for another thing**, with these lights, the sky would be so bright that interfere the use of astronomy equipment.
>
> **The man agrees with that on account of the following reasons**. **First**, the third floor of the library has been closed for few months and it's a waste of money to go for just looks. **Second**, they've been tracking a comet all semester long and the lights will stop them using the telescopes anymore. He chose the school just for this program actually. If so, he will have to turn to textbook for the pictures. while only hands-on experience can get everyone excited and everyone will be disappointed.

### Reading Material

<center>Make Textbook List Available Earlier</center>

Students always have to *wait* until the **beginning of the semester** to find out which **textbooks** they will need for their new **courses**. But since a lot of students **register** *early* for their courses, I think that **the list for each course** should be available *immediately at* the time of *registration*. This would give **students more time** to **shop** around to find **less expensive textbooks**. And it would also allow them to **start work on the teaching** for their new courses *early*.

Sincerely,

Alexandra Brown

### Listening Material

M-Hey, did you see Alexandra's letter?

W-Yeah, what do you think?

*M*-Well, it's *great*. She really makes some good points. Like, the thing with the **university bookstore** is, if you buy a **brand new textbook**, it can be *pretty expensive*, and they usually have only *a few* **used textbooks** around... they're **cheaper** of course, but they *sell out quickly*.

W-That's true.

M-So this would give **students time** to look around *on their own*, you know, may be they could **find** the books they need *online*, get books a few months ahead of time using the internet.

W-I agree.

M-So this way, students might be able to **save** a little **money**.

W-Right, so what do you think about her *second* point, about the **reading assignments**?

*M*-I *agree* with that, too! It just makes a lot of sense, because things get *really* **busy** when the **semester first starts** and it can be *hard* to find **time** to **keep up** with all of these **assignments**. But students usually have some **free time** right *before* the **start of the semester**.

W-So, we'd have a good opportunity to do some preparation.

M-Exactly.

> The man express his opinion about the proposal described in the letter. Briefly **summarize** the proposal. Then **state** his opinion about the proposal and **explain** the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.
>
> **In the letter**, **Alexandra propose** that student should be informed immediately of what textbooks they'll need for the courses they chose, while now they'll have to wait until the semester begins. **For one thing**, students could possibly find cheaper textbooks; **for another thing**, they can start work on the courses early.
>
> **The man thinks Alexandra's ideas are great on account of the following reasons**. **First**, the university bookstore sell expensive new textbook and there're only a few used one, cheaper but also gone quickly. **So he thinks that** given the textbook information, students might find a cheaper one online and save some money. **Second**, students are busy at the beginning of the semester and it'll be hard to keep up these reading assignments at that time. However they usually are freer before that. **So he agrees that** they can do some preparation.

### Reading Material

<center>An Art Museum at the University?</center>

**Many universities** have their own art museums, with collections of paintings and sculptures by **well-known artists**. I *think* our university should create a **similar museum** on our own campus. Such a museum would give our **students** an **opportunity** to **learn to appreciate high-quality fine art**. It would be a great way for us to see artworks that we might *not* have access to *otherwise*. *In order to pay* for the museum, the university could write letters to **alumni** asking them to **donate money** to help build the museum. I'm sure many former students love art and would be glad to donate money to help the university build a museum here.

Sincerely,

Diane Miller

### Listening

W-Did you see this letter?

*M*-Yeah. It's a nice idea, but it'll *never happen*.

W-Why do you say that?

M-Well, first of all, you can get on a **bus** right here on campus, and in **half an hour** you're downtown at the county **art museum**.

W-That's true.

M-And if you show your student **ID** card, it only costs like **two bucks** to get in.

W-Yeah. In fact, on **Mondays**, students get in for **free**.

M-Right. And you can see some of the **greatest art** in the world there. For example, you know *Rembrandt*, the **famous** Dutch **painter**?

W-Yeah.

M-Well, right now they're *showing* something like twenty of this **paintings**.

W-Wow.

M-Yeah. And you know, it's true, we do have a lot of very *generous* **alumni**. But we're already asking them for helping building a new **student center**, and a new **library**. And these are both very *expensive* projects.

W-Yeah, that's right.

M-So I *don't think* we can expect them to donate much money for anything else anytime soon. Especially for something we don't really need. 

> The man expresses his opinion about the letter-writer's proposal. Briefly **summarize** the proposal. Then **state** the man's opinion and **explain** the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.
>
> **In the letter**, **Diane propose that** an in-campus art museum should be built. That's to teach students how to appreciate high-quality fine art which we'll not have access to otherwise. And the building fee could be covered by the donation from the alumni.
>
> **The man think Diane's ideas will never happen on account of the following reasons**. **First**, **students** can take a bus to the art museum downtown for half an hour. The ticket fee is 2 dollars and free on Monday with a student ID card. Now there's an exhibition from a famous Dutch painter. So he thinks students have already had the opportunity to appreciate the art. **Second**, the alumni have already donate much for two expensive projects: a new student center and a new library. He won't expect another donation soon. So he thinks that the building fee cannot be covered.



## TPO 47

### Reading

<center>Professor Evaluations</center>

The university requires **students** to complete **written valuations** of their **professors** at the end of each course taught during the semester. *But* current system is **private**, since *only* the **professors** actually read the evaluations once the student submit them. I *suggest* that the university **publish** these **evaluation** **online** for **everyone** to read. Both professors and students would **benefit** from having these evaluation published. *Professor* would feel more **motivated** to **improve** their teaching if they knew that their evaluations were publicly available to all students. *In addition*, prospective *students* could read the evaluation and make more **informed decisions** about which classes they want to take.

Sincerely,

Chris Jacobs

### Listening

N-

M-Did you see this?

*W*-Yeah, but I *don't* think it'll work.

M-Why not?

W-Well, I don't think *professors* would be too happy to have their **teaching styles publicly criticized**. *Besides*, they might **not** even bother **reading** the online evaluations, if they think there will be **negative criticism** in them.

M-You really think that'll happen?

W-Sure! And so the professors won't take them *seriously* or be *influenced* in any way... **nothing**'s going to **change**.

M-OK. But at least students who might take their courses in the future will read them.

W-That's true. But students who write the evaluations usually do it on the *last day of class* and they're all in a **hurry** to leave. They don't want to bother spending *much* **time** on them, so they *don't* say **anything specific** or **helpful** about the professor or the course.

M-I see what you mean.

W-So this whole idea may not work at all.

> The woman express her **opinion** about the proposal in the letter. Briefly **summarize** the proposal. Then **state** the woman's opinion and **explain** the reasons she gives for holding that opinion.
>
> **In the letter**, **Chris proposed that** the university should publish the professor evaluation by students for everyone. For one thing, professor will be further motivated given that the evaluations are available to all students. For another thing, students can have more information when deciding which courses to choose.
>
> **In the conversation**, **the woman disagree with the proposal**. **From her point of view**, **first**, professors won't take the criticism serious. They might be unhappy to be publicly criticized or read the negative criticism; **second**, the evaluation is not helpful or specific. Students usually do evaluations on the last day of class and won't spend much time. So they're all in a hurry and leave.

### Reading

<center>No More Posters Outside the Student Center</center>

Traditionally, students have been permitted to **put up posters** advertising events, clubs, and activities on the concrete wall outside the main entrance to the student center. Beginning next semester, however, **students** will **no longer be allowed** to attach anything to the front of the building. According to a ***university*** official, the new policy is part of an effort to **improve** the campus's **appearance**. "The posters on the wall make the building unattractive," he said, "so they have to come down." He added that posters can instead be displayed in the **dining hall**: "Students can use the bulletin board in the dining hall for posters, so the policy change should not be a **problem**."

### Listening

*W*-It's really too **bad** about this new policy.

M-Why do you say that?

W-Well, I mean, you don't notice it so much now, but if you take a good look at that building, it's pretty **boring**, just your basic square building with gray concrete walls and no kind of ornamentation or anything to make it interesting.

M-Yes, I guess that's true, now that I think about it.

W-Yeah. The stuff that goes up there now-a lot of it's artistic and colorful. It gives the building **character** and **personality**.

M-True.

W-*Plus*, it's always **changing**, and that's **cool**, too.

M-Yeah, you're right.

W-So what's gonna be left? A boring, old, concrete wall.

M-Yeah, I guess it will be kind of plain.

W-Yeah, and the idea about the dining hall... **Not everybody eats there**. A lot of students eat at the **snack bar**, or **off campus**... Some students bring lunch from home and eat outside under the trees.

M-That's true. I never eat in the dining hall.

W-OK, see what I mean? So how are you gonna see those announcement?

M-I won't.

W-I rest my case.

> The woman expresses her opinion about the new policy. Briefly describe the policy. Then state the woman's opinion about the policy, and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion.
>
> **In the letter**, **we see that** the university **proposed** that no more posters outside the student center shall be allowed. **For one thing**, this would result in a better appearance; **for another thing**, student can still put up their posters in the dinning hall.
>
> **In the conversation**, the woman **is not on board with** the university, **on account of the following reasons**. **OK, from her point of view**, **firstly**, posters can give the building character and personality. It's also cool since it's always change. It would be boring without posters. **So** this proposal won't make a better appearance; **secondly**, not everybody eats in the dinning hall and lots of students doesn't. **Thus, it's not like what's been said in the proposal.** There'll a **problem** that many students won't see the posters.
>
> **These are the reasons why** *she* **disagree with that proposal**.

<center>Close the Coffeehouse</center>

Like many people, I was happy when the university opened a coffeehouse. A coffeehouse is a perfect place to meet people or to study while having a coffee. Unfortunately, our coffeehouse is usually empty, so it's not a good place to meet people. And the lighting there is very poor, so it's not a good place to meet people, either. A coffeehouse seemed like a great idea, but it just hasn't worked out, and the time has come for the university to close it.

Sincerely,

Marvin Baker

### Listening

W-I disagree with his idea.

M-Why? It doesn't sound like it's doing very much business.

W-That's probably because he goes during the day. But in the evening...

M-Oh, people go...

W-A lot of people. Students are really busy during the day with classes, jobs, and studying. But at night the place is often pretty full. Students get together there all the time.

M-Really?

W-Yeah. It's not until night time that students actually have the time to sit down and relax—you know, enjoy a hot drink and something to eat, while hanging out or reading for class.

M-So you can read in there?

W-Yeah... I mean, he's right, that used to be a problem, but recently they did some renovations, and now I think the lighting's as good as in the library.

M-Really?

W-Yeah, and not just at a few tables. Just about every table's got good lighting now.

M-Sounds like this guy doesn't know what he's talking about.

W-Definitely not.

> The woman disagrees with the student's proposal for the coffeehouse. Explain the proposal and the reasons she gives for disagreeing with it.

<center>Create Student Committee to Decide Funding for Student Organizations</center>

I think students should be in charge of deciding which student organizations (for example, the jazz band or the hiking club) receive money from the university. Students should also be in charge of how much money each organization receives. A special committee made up of students could be created to make theses decisions. Currently, these funding decisions are made by university administrators, but a student committee would b=know better than the administrators which organizations are most important to students and most deserving of the university's financial support. I'm sure a lot of students would be interested in serving on the committee, and those who do serve will gain valuable leadership experience.

Sincerely,

Bill Jones

### Listening

N-

W-So what do you think of the proposal?

M-I don't like it.

W-Why not?

M-Actually, I don't think students are the right people to be making these decisions. They're too close to the situation.

W-What do you mean?

M-Well, because students are directly involved in the groups, they can't be as objective, as fair, as administrators. I mean, what will prevent students on the committee from just giving money to their friends' groups... or, or favoring the groups they're in themselves? I think having the university administrators make the decisions is more fair.

W-Well, at least, it would be good experience for the students who serve on the committee.

M-Well, that's another thing. I think they'd have a hard time finding students to serve on it. I mean, there're already a number of leadership positions open in various campus groups, but most students just aren't interested in them.

W-That's true—the student council doesn't even have a vice president.

M-Right. Most students are just too busy. There's no way you're gonna find enough students who are willing to volunteer their time for this committee. It's too big of a time commitment.

    University Makes Changes to Orientation Program
</center>

Madison University is making a change to the orientation program for first-year students. In the past, as part of orientation, new, incoming students could go on a two-day hiking and camping trip together with other incoming students on the weekend before classes begin. In order to encourage more students to take advantage of the opportunity to get to know one another in an informal setting, the university will now off a choice of activities: students will be able to either go hiking or participate in organized group games on campus. Additionally, these activities will last one day only, not two, a change many students had requested.

### Listening

M-Interesting isn't it? I wish they'd made this change two years ago, when we got here. This program is going to be much more attractive this way, to lots more people.

W-Why?

M-It's a question of choice. See, not everyone likes the same things. The way it used to be, if, like, you didn't like sleeping in the tent, well, you just didn't participate. Lots of people didn't.

W-That's true. I didn't go on the camping trip my first year, hiking and camping isn't my thing, but you know I did feel I missed out on something.

M-Right. Plus, the other reason this is going to work, is that you don't have to give up your whole weekend anymore. There are other things people need to do their first few days. You know, like buy their books, set up their rooms, prepare for the first day of classes, that kind of thing. The big time commitment used to get in the way.

    No More Evening Classes?
</center>

The administration has announced that starting next fall, the university will stop offering evening classes in many departments. According to a university administrator, the decision was prompted by a steady decline in enrollments in evening classes. "Evening classes are just too small," the administrator said. When asked to explain the decline in enrollments, the administrator pointed to the fact that most evening classes are taught by teaching assistants, who are usually graduate students. "Surveys show that students prefer to take classes taught by experienced faculty members," the spokesperson said, "probably because they simply know more than graduate teaching assistants do."

### Listening

M-I just don't know about this decision.

W-It sort of makes sense to me.

M-Not to me. I don't understand their reasoning. I mean what's wrong with small classes? I think that's what students actually prefer. And it's easy to see why.

W-Yeah, you do get to participate more.

M-Definitely. You can be more actively involved, get more attention and support. It's just a better way to learn.

W-OK, but there is that survey.

M-I don't know what students they asked, but I know a lot of people who feel just the opposite. I mean, what does "experienced" mean, anyway? Sometimes it means you've been teaching the same subject for 20 years and you're probably tired of it by now and maybe not very enthusiastic.

W-Yeah, that does happen.

M-Whereas if it's the first time or maybe second you're teaching a class, well, it's going to be more exciting to you, and you're going to communicate that excitement to the people you're teaching. At least, that's how I see it.

### Reading

The final project for this course will be an oral presentation. Students must work with an assigned partner to select a topic and complete all related research for the project. The partners will orally present their research to the class during the last two weeks of classes. This project will provide students with the opportunity to discover the rewards and challenges of working with another individual, and experience that help them in future endeavors.

Furthermore, these presentations will benefit the entire class: when students share their discoveries with the class, they enable other students to learn from their work.

### Listening

W-I don't know about this.

M-Why not? Sounds OK to me.

W-Thing is, depending on someone else makes me nervous. My roommate had to do a project like this, and the other girls didn't show up to meetings, didn't do any research—My roommate had to do everything herself.

M-That's a drag. I guess if your partner's irresponsible, you're out of luck.

W-Exactly. It heart her grade. I don't want the same thing to happen to me. Right now I'm more concerned with getting a good grade even though I know that's not the lesson the professor has in mind.

M-Still, it'll be good to listen to everyone's stuff.

W-Well, I don't know. I mean, at the end of the semester, people are focused on studying for exams.

M-Yeah.

W-Who has time to put something like this together when they're busy studying

M-True.

W-I can't imagine anyone will be able to really do a good job with it. And everyone will be so preoccupied by then, that they probably won't listen anyway. I think the professor's gonna be disappointed, and students? Well, we'll all just be frustrated by the whole thing.

    University to Create a Lounge for Commuter Students
</center>

Many students at our university do not live in dormitories. These students live in town or in the suburbs and travel to campus every day. The university has decided to provide these commuter students with a special lounge in the student center—with couches, chairs, and a television. University officials hope that this lounge—a place to socialize and relax—will give commuter students some of the same advantages that dormitory residents now have. An important additional feature of the lounge will be a bulletin board on the wall for posting and sharing information that may be especially useful to commuter students and their particular needs.

### Listening

W-Hey, it's nice they're gonna do this.

M-It's not a bad idea. But do you think it'll accomplish what they're hoping?

W-Sure, I mean, the dormitory all have their own lounges, and think about how much time students spend there, and how many people they meet.

M-Yeah, I got to know a lot of people in my dorm during my first semester, just by watching TV and taking study breaks in the lounge.

W-Right, those dorm lounges are really central to student life. And I met people there that really helped me with my school work, too. Student who live off campus don't have anything like that.

M-That's true.

W-Plus, I like the idea of posting stuff. You know, things like notices from students who want to get together with other students to share car rides to campus.

M-Yeah, ride-share information could be helpful.

W-Absolutely. If students knew about ride-shares, they can save money getting to campus, 'cause a few of them could travel in one car.

    Start a Ride-Sharing Program
</center>

Students who live off-campus often get to campus by car. I propose that the university create a student ride-sharing program, where students who live in the same area would form groups of four with each group driving to campus together in one car. The ride-sharing program would benefit students as well as the environment. For the students, they would save money by driving to campus in groups instead of separately. And since there would be fewer cars going and coming from campus, there could be a positive impact on the environment.

### Listening

M-Ellen, you drive to campus, right? Did you see this letter in the paper today?

W-Yeah, I did. I think it makes a lot of sense. So it'd great if the university starts something like that.

M-OK.

W-Well, now I drive to campus all by myself and buy gas now and then. It isn't much each time I fill the tank, but, it adds up.

M-I'm sure.

W-So a program like that would really help students. They'd spend less on gas, and it's not just gas, either. It's also the wear, and tear on the car. I mean, the more you use a car going back and forth all the time, the more you have to do maintenance and repairs.

M-Right, but do you think the program would have that other benefit?

W-I do, because there've been a lot more people coming into the city, so, there's much more traffic now than before. And all the carbon dioxide that comes from all those cars on the road is polluting the environment more and more.

M-So, with this program,

W-Right, there'll be less carbon dioxide pouring out into the air. And this will reduce environment pollution and the air quality would certainly improve.

    Student Plays Should Be Free for Everyone
</center>
Thanks to our superb theater program here at the university, we are fortunate to be able to see many plays that are put on by student actors. However, while all employees and students at the university may attend these plays for free, anyone who is not directly associated with the university must pay a fee to attend. I think student plays should be open to everyone free of charge. That way, people in the local community could benefit from having a free entertainment option in town. It would also be good for the student actors, since it would help to ensure larger audiences at the plays.

### Listening

W-Hey, Paul, you're an actor, right? What do you think about this idea?

M-I think it's great.

W-Oh, yeah?

M-Absolutely. I mean, for the people in town, there's sometimes not a lot going on, not a lot to do. There's not even a movie theater nearby. And if you want to see a professional show, you've to travel. I think the nearest professional theater is like an hour away.

W-Yeah, plus, those professional plays can be really expensive. I saw one last semester, and the ticket cost me like forty dollars.

M-Right. So it'll be good for people to have another entertainment option, an opportunity to see live show that won't be so expensive.

W-Sure.

M-Plus, it would definitely helpful for us actors.

W-Yeah?

M-Yeah, because on some nights, there's not a lot of people that go, not a lot of people there to watch us, and that can have a bad effect on the show—it might not be as good.

W-Yeah, I can imagine it must be a completely different energy for you and the other actors, if the seats are half empty.

M-Exactly. Like, if the show is a comedy and it's supposed to be funny, in order for it to really seem funny, there needs to be a lot of people there to laugh at the jokes, otherwise, it just doesn't seem as humorous. Having a crowd there laughing at the jokes really helps the show along, help it to be good.

W-That makes sense. So this proposal would help that.

M-Yeah, help make it more likely that there'd be a full house, a lot of people watching.

    Room Phones are Unnecessary
</center>

As part of the cost of student housing, students pay to have phones in their dormitory rooms. I think this is unnecessary, and the university should remove the phones from students' rooms. Room phones are not needed since students all have mobile phones we can use to make calls instead. Removing the room phones would also have a cost benefit for students, since we would save money if we didn't have to pay the cost of phone service for the rooms.

### Listening

W-Hey Jimmy, did you read this?

M-I did, yeah. What do you think about it?

W-I don't know. I don't think it'd be a very good idea.

M-Oh yeah? But it's true that a lot of us have our own phones.

W-Yeah, but it's good to have both. The service we get with our phones isn't always reliable. Maybe it's cause there are a lot of hills around here, but my service doesn't work that well in this area. A lot of times calls get cut off or the reception isn't good. I can't hear the person on the other line.

M-Yeah, I've had some friends say that too actually.

W-So, it's good to have a backup option, something we can use if our own phones aren't working.

M-I see what you mean. But when you think of the money,

W-Well, I don't buy his argument there either. Because I don't know if you've noticed this on the housing bill we get from the university, but right now we only pay per call.

M-Oh, really?

W-Yeah, so if you don't make many calls, you don't pay much. I mean if you use it a lot, of course, you'll pay more, but student can avoid that if they just avoid using it as much as possible.

M-Oh, I see. OK.

W-So, I think they should just keep it the way it is now.

    Allow Laptops in Class
</center>

Though most of us own laptop computers, we are currently not allowed to use them during class. I think this policy should be changed. Since most of us type faster than we write by hand, taking notes on a computer would be quicker and easier, so we could pay more attention to professors' lectures. Also, since laptop computers have Internet access, professors could direct students to view Web sites with useful information while lectures are going on. They could look up useful facts and background information on a topic or view different photographs or illustrations of something the professor is describing. This would help students gain more complete understanding of lecture topics.

### Listening

W-Did you see this letter in the paper?

M-Yeah, but I don't think it's a good idea.

W-Why not?

M-Well, 'cause I think students would pay even less attention to the professor not more. I think they'd be too much of a distraction.

W-How so?

M-Well, maybe some students would actually use laptops to take notes,

W-I would.

M-OK, you would. But a lot of people, most people, would be too busy playing around with them instead. You know, surfing the Internet, emailing friends, playing computer games, that kind of stuff.

W-Huh, so you really think they'd pay less attention?

M-Yeah, really, I think that's what would happen.

W-All right, but what about his second point? Don't you think if students had them in class, professors would be able to use the Internet as a teaching tool?

M-Well, the problem with that, is that not everyone has a laptop computer—only some people have one.

W-True.

M-So you see, not everyone would be able to follow along. It wouldn't be useful as a teaching tool if only some students could follow along but not others.4

W-I see what you mean.

    University Should Allow Students to Audit Classes
</center>

Many universities allow students to audit classes. That is, students may attend lectures and discussions for a particular class without completing the assignments, receiving a grade, or earning credit for the class. I think our university should also allow this. Auditing classes would be good for interested students, since they would be able to learn more and experience a variety of different classes that they would not otherwise be able to take. Furthermore, it shouldn't create any difficulties or additional obligations for professors, because these students wouldn't take tests or write papers that need to be graded.

### Listening

M-Did you see this letter, Molly?

W-Yeah, but I don't agree with him.

M-Why not?

W-Well, it might has some educational benefit for the people doing it, but overall, for the other students who are actually taking the classes, it wouldn't be good.

M-How come?

W-Because anyone who is taking the class for a grade, for credit, puts in a lot of time preparing for it, doing the reading and assignments, whereas people who aren't, they might not be as well prepared, and that would affect the quality of the class discussion.

M-You mean, the discussions wouldn't be at a very high level?

W-Right, because people who aren't taking the class for a grade would be asking really basic questions. They'll be slowing down the class discussion by taking time to discuss basic stuff, that was already covered in the reading assignments.

M-That's a good point. I can see how that might happen.

W-Plus, he's wrong about the work it requires for the professor.

M-But it's true the professor doesn't have to grade anything.

W-Sure, but there're lots of other, little things, that can add up to more work, like they'd have to prepare extra handouts for the class, learn extra names, and well, possibly stay after class to answer those students questions.

M-Yeah. I guess that's all extra work.

W-Absolutely, all this little things add up, and require the professor's attention.

    Program to Provide Free Tutoring
</center>

The university has announced that starting with the fall semester, free tutoring will be available to all new students for their entire first year. The academic dean, James Maxwell, commented, "The university is aware of the academic problems that many first-year students face when making the transition from high school to college." The new tutoring program, he said, is designed to assist first-year students who want or need additional support with their academic course work. The program will also be organized so that individual students can arrange to work with tutors majoring in their own chosen field of study.

### Listening

M-Hey, did you read about this plan?

W-Yeah, and I think it's a really great idea.

M-Why is that?

W-Well, a lot of new students really need this. I mean, it's not just about getting extra help with the course material, they'll probably also get information about things like taking notes, or the best way to study for exams.

M-Yeah, I barely even knew how to do those things when I first came here.

W-Neither did I. So these are things most students wind up having to learn on their own at first. That's why so many of them have a hard time.

M-And it's probably good that they can work with somebody who has the same interests.

W-Right, that would be a real advantage, to get information about the classes you are gonna need to take from somebody who's already taken those classes. And they could recommend professors, and tell you who the best advisors in the department are, things like that.

M-I see what you mean. So new students could get access to information about the program from another student's point of view.

W-Exactly.

    Bicycle Borrowing Program
</center>

It's great that the university has a program where students can borrow bicycles from the gym. However, two changes would make the program more convenient. First, the borrowing period should be shortened to four hours maximum so that more bikes would be available when students want to borrow them. Second, currently, students who borrow bikes have to leave a cash deposit, which is returned to them when they return the bikes. But I think students should be required to leave their student identification cards instead, so they don't have to remember to bring cash.

### Listening

W-Hey, did you read that letter? What do you think?

M-Yeah, I read it. I understand what she's saying, but I really don't agree with her suggestions.

W-How come?

M-Well, students often need to borrow the bikes for longer periods of time, sometimes a whole day.

W-What for?

M-Well, like to do stuff off campus. For instance, my friends and I, on the weekends, sometimes we'd like to ride bikes to the state park outside of town and do some hiking there, and it's basically takes the whole day. It's nighttime by the time we get back.

W-So if you had less time, you  wouldn't be able to that.

M-Right. And also her other suggestion doesn't seem practical to me.

W-The card thing?

M-Yeah, that's not gonna work. What if you want to enter a campus building? Even though you can get into most of the classroom buildings without a card, there are certain buildings on campus where you need to show your card to get in, like the library and dining hall.

W-That's true, so students wouldn't be able to go to any of those places till they got their cards back.

    An Airport Bus for School Breaks
</center>

Students who fly home for the winter and spring breaks need to get to and from the airport, which is a half-hour drive from campus. I think the university should run a free bus service for students between campus and the airport during the breaks. This would help the students, since there is no public transportation between campus and the airport. In order to provide service to the airport, some of the buses that normally run between campus buildings when classes are in session could run between the school and the airport during the school breaks.

### Listening

W-Did you see this, Jim? What do you think about her idea?

M-I think it'd be great. Id'd  make things much less expensive. 'Cause our campus is located outside the city. If you can't get a friend with a car to give you a ride, there's no other way to get to the airport, and your only choice is to take a taxi.

W-I know, I've had to take a taxi before and it's pretty expensive.

M-Like thirty, or forty dollars, which is a lot, especially for students.

W-Yeah, definitely.

M-And I think it would work, what she'd suggesting. I mean, there's less need for busses on campus during that time, to take students between the buildings.

W-You mean, because classes are over then?

M-Yeah, exactly. There might be some final exams still going on, but regular classes won't be meeting. There're much fewer students left on campus, and they don't need to get around campus that often.

W-Yeah, I guess they're just making occasional trips to take exams or go the the library or gym or whatever.

M-Right, it shouldn't cause any problem for anyone who still needs to get around campus.
