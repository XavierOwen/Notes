#﻿Task 5

Xavier

## Intro

20s/60s

**Briefly summarize the problem** the speakers are discussing. Then state **which** of the **two** solutions from the conversation **you would recommend**. **Explain the reasons** for your recommendation.

- Time, Location, People, Object/Thing, Degree, Reason
- Why you recommend

---

### How to analysis - general guide

- time, in applicable
- person who propose an idea
- type of problem
  - if **time conflict**: which two? 
    - if on the same person, usually, it's "study" and something else, like "work", "play"
    - if on two persons, find the exact things they're discussing
  - if **lack of something**: lack of what?
- Key to recommend: the **adjectives** that indicate the degree the speaker prefer, *not* the convenience; and the *number* they mentioned:
  - important
  - favorite
  - great
  - a lot
  - first



### Template

**In the conversation, the speaker is *bothered* by a time conflict**/**for lack of something**. blahblahblah. **He/She/They are now on the horns of a dilemma**.

- suggested
- indicated
- proposed

However/At the same time,

**From my point of view**, **I'd suggest that**, **to make the best of this situation**, somebody **should** blah(, **instead of doing** blahblahblah), **on account of the following reasons**. **First**, blahblahblah. **Second**, blahblahblah. **So in this case**, blahblahblah. (**The other one is just, kinda inappropriate.**)

## TPO 32

- Summer Break
- Time conflict: study and work
  1. work less to finish the paper: less good impression
  2. hand in after a week: less grades

M-I don't know about you, but I'm really looking forward to summer break.

W-I can't even think of that far ahead. I have got so much to do before the end of this semester. I've been feeling pretty stressed out lately.

M-Why? What's going on?

W-Well, I just have so many assignments. I've got three major research papers to do and they're all due basically at the same time, in two weeks.

M-Wow, three? That's a lot. And research papers take a lot of time.

W-Right, and between my job and classes, there just aren't enough hours in the day to get them all done.

M-Well, is there anything you could cut from your schedule? I mean, you are working part-time in an office in town, aren't you? Why don't you just reduce your hours there for a while? At least until you can get the papers done.

W-I guess I can tell my boss I need to cut back on my hours for a couple of weeks. Ah, but I don't know. I haven't been working there very long. I don't want make a bad impression by asking for time off already.

M-What else could you do?

W-Well, another option is, I could get an extension on one of the papers. I asked one of my professors about it, my history professor, and she said it would be OK if I handed the paper in a week late. So, then I could just concentrate on getting the other two papers done first.

M-Oh, well that's great.

W-Yeah, and only she said, she'd have to take a few points off the grade for the paper, since it would be late, you know, to be fair to the other students.

M-Oh, that'a drag. So what are you gonna do?

W-Uh, I don't know yet.



## TPO 33

- Some time: Friday night
- Time conflict: thing on myself, thing on you
  1. **rehearsal**: less polite (man), lack of friends (woman)
  2. work: lack of rehearsal (man)

M-Tina, I'm so glad that I bumped into you.

W-Hey, Bob, what's up?

M-Well, you know how I told you I could work for you tonight? Cover your shift at the dining hall later?

W-Yeah, thanks so much for that. Friday night dinner shift are tough to find substitutes for.

M-Well, actually...

W-Oh, no. Don't tell me something came up, and you're canceling.

M-Um, yeah. I'm afraid I forget tonight I've got a music rehearsal for the band I'm in.

W-Music rehearsal?

M-Yeah. I play keyboards for a little rock band here on campus and we've got practice tonight to prepare for a concert we're doing that's coming up. It's really kind of **important**.

W-Well, I don't know what to do now, because I already made plans to go to the schools play with some friends tonight.

M-Oh.

W-Yeah. And there's no way I can find someone else to work my shift now. It's so last-minute.

M-I'm really sorry, Tina.

W-Well, I guess I could cancel my plans to see the play, go see it another time by myself since my friends are seeing it tonight. I think it's playing for another week.

M-Or, you know, I guess I could talk to the band leader, explain to him that I can't make the band practice tonight.

W-Yeah?

M-And I want to do the right thing here, since I **did said** I'd work for you. It's just that some of the songs are new to me, and tonight's our last practice before the concert. I don't want the sound bad at the show.

> **In the conversation**, the man is bothered by a **time conflict**. He promised the woman to cover her shift at the dinning hall this Friday night, **however** he has just remembered that there's a music rehearsal for his band at that time, which is important for him.
>
> The woman first **suggested** that she can do the job instead of go to see the play with friends, so that the man could go to the rehearsal; the man then **indicated** that he should go to do the shift, it's his promise after all.
>
> **From my point of view**, **I'd suggest that**, **to make the best of this situation**, he should go to the rehearsal and the woman should do the job, on account of the following reasons. The first is that the rehearsal is really important and it's his last chance however the play is on another time; the second is that he can cover her shift another Friday night as a compensation. I believe it's really a great chance for the man to be a friend with the woman and go to see the play together with her next time.



## TPO 34

- Some time: next week
- Lack of: passport
  1. write a paper: lack of trip experience
  2. pay extra: lack of money

W-Hey Mike, how's it going?

M-OK.

W-Something the matter?

M-Well, sort of. I'm taking this French class...

W-OK.

M-and one of the class requirements is a weekend trip to Canada, to Montreal, which is in the French-speaking part of Canada. It's only like five hours from here, so next weekend the whole class is going up on a bus. We're supposed to practice French. You know, talk to people, and we're going to a play.

W-Sounds like fun.

M-Yeah, I'd **love** to go...

W-But?

M-Well, we'll be crossing an international border, so in order to go, you need a passport. The professor told us a while ago to be sure to get a passport, but I completely forgot to apply for one.

W-What're you gonna do?

M-Well, I talked to my professor and she said I can fulfil the requirement a different way if I want. Instead going on the trip, I could stay here and write a short paper about Montreal.

W-In French?

M-Yeah, I'd have to a little research and write about three pages about Montreal—it's history or whatever—in French. It wouldn't be too hard.

W-But then you'd miss out on a **great** trip to Montreal.

M-I know.

W-Well, you know, there's another option. You can probably still get a passport in time if you go directly to U.S. passport office and pay extra. Then you could go!

M-Yeah, actually, I looked into that. I can still get a passport in time, but to get it at the last minute's expensive—like a hundred and fifty dollars. And I don't know if I want to spend that much.

W-That is a lot of money.



## TPO 35

- Summer break
- Lack of: furniture
  1. buy used furniture nearby: less furniture available & lack of money
  2. move my own furniture: lack of convenience

W-Hey Jim, How's it going? Got plans for the summer yet?

M-Yeah, actually I got a month long internship in a town about three hours from here, working at a magazine. Pretty excited.

W-An internship with a magazine? Very cool.

M-Yeah, I'm excited to get to know a new area too.

W-So have you found a place to stay for the month?

M-Actually, I have. But I'm gonna keep my apartment here on campus while I'm gone—keep paying rent on it—and so I'm just going to be renting a room during the internship, you know, to save money.

W-Makes sense.

M-Yeah, and the room I found is pretty cheap and in a great location—very close to the magazine where I'll be working. Only thing is, it doesn't come with any furniture.

W-Nothing?

M-No, nothing—the room isn't furnished, no desk, no chairs, no bed, no sofa... so I'll have to do something about that. I was going to try to see if I could buy some inexpensive used furniture once I get up there.

W-Sounds good. I'm sure there are plenty of places you can buy cheap stuff.

M-And maybe sell once the internship is over. Only thing is, it's not guaranteed I'll be able to find everything I need for cheap prices, and I don't want to spend a lot since it's just for the month.

W-Well, what about the furniture you already have in your apartment here on campus?

M-Yeah, I do have some nice pieces of furniture in my apartment that I could move to the room, but I don't have a way to get it there? I'd have to rent a truck or something. It'd kind of a hassle loading it in the truck, carrying it up and down all the stairs... driving the three hours...

W-Yeah, and then you'd have to move it all back after the month was over.



## TPO 36

- Some time: weekend
- Time conflict: thing on myself, thing on you
  1. ask her sister to come early: lack of politeness
  2. go skiing on Sunday: lack of skiing hours

M-Hey, Samantha.  I heard there's a big ski trip planned for this weekend.

W-Right. The ski club is going up to Mount Henderson this weekend.

M-That'll be fun.

W-I know, but I kinda have a problem. My cousin called and she's coming here this weekend. She has some kind of conference in town on Saturday, and, anyway, she wants to get together for dinner Saturday night.

M-So what'd you tell her?

W-Of course, I couldn't really say no. And anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing her. She's a lot of fun. It's just that

M-Now you have to figure out how to see her and go on the ski trip.

W-Exactly... how can I do both? Got any ideas?

M-Well, you could explain to her that you already made plans to go on the ski trip. Ask her if she'd be willing to come to town on Friday instead of Saturday. That way you two could get together before her conference starts.

W-Hmm. I'm sure she'd be willing to come on Friday if I asked her to. Then we could go out for dinner Friday night instead of Saturday night.

M-And you could go skiing on Saturday like you planned.

W-Yeah... the only problem is that I'm a little worried about offending her... you know, asking her to come early so I don't have to change my plans.

M-Well, you did make plans to go skiing **first**.

W-True.

M-But... I do have another idea. You could just go for part of the ski trip.

W-What do you mean?

M-Well, instead of going on Saturday with the rest of the group, why don't you just drive up to Mount Henderson on Sunday. That way you get to spend Saturday night with your cousin and you could meet the group and go skiing on Sunday.

W-Wow. That's another good idea. It's just that... I'm not sure it's worth to go up on Sunday. I only get a couple of hours of skiing and then it'd be time to come back.



## TPO 37

- Some time: everyday
- Lack of: money to fix the car
  1. borrow from brother: no practical sense
  2. take bus to save money: lack of convenience

W-So Mike, you said you wanted to move off campus. Did you ever find an apartment?

M-Yeah, I did.

W-So how is it?

M-Oh, it's great, except that it's pretty far from the campus. It's on the other side of town.

W-Oh, so you have a pretty long commute to campus then?

M-Yeah... and now, can you believe it, my car broke down!

W-Oh, wow. That's too bad.

M-Well, the car's pretty old, so I'm not surprised it broke down. But it's gonna cost a lot of money to get it fixed... a lot more than I can afford right now.

W-So what are you gonna do? You need a car to get to campus, right?

M-Yeah. One option would be to borrow the money to fix the car. I talked to my brother. He is out of school and working now, and he said he'd loan me the money to get it fixed.

W-That's really nice of him.

M-Definitely. But if I borrow the money from him, I still have to pay it back pretty soon. That'll be tough since I only have a part-time job.

W-Yeah. That could take a while. Do you have any other options?

M-Well, I'm also thinking about not fixing the car right now. Maybe try to save the money and just take the bus or something.

W-So you can get the bus near your house?

M-Yeah, there's a but stop a couple of blocks from my apartment. Trouble is, I have to change buses a couple of times so it takes a really long time to get to campus, and a long time to get back home. I'd really have to adjust my schedule.

W-I see. That doesn't sound very convenient.

> **In the conversation**, the man is **bothered** for lack of money to fix his car. And the sad thing is he has just moved off campus and it's pretty far. However, his car just broke down so he have to fix it, and it costs a lot.
>
> The man first **indicated** that he can borrow from his brother, and pay back soon. Then he **proposed** an alternative plan, to take the bus or something.
>
> **From my point of view**, **I'd suggest that, to make the best of this situation**, he should take the bus **instead of** borrowing from his brother, **on account of the following reasons**. **First**, it makes no practical sense to just borrow  the money and pay it back soon, and it's really not a good idea to not pay the owed money since he is a relative. Second, he only need to reschedule once and the convenience would be overcome. And the fact is that he can do pretty much his work in the bus, so in this case, he doesn't need to worry about short on time and money.



## TPO 38

- Some time: tomorrow
- Lack of: psychology textbook
  1. study notes: lack of time to study textbook
  2. study with the guy: less time to study textbook on my own

W-Hey Jeff, how's it going?

M-Not too good. You know how I work as a lab assistant in one of the science labs?

W-Yeah.

M-Well, I was in there this afternoon, and I had some textbooks with me, and I accidently left one of my psychology books in there; it's a special book our teacher loaned each student in the class, so I can't get anywhere else. And now the lad's locked up for the night.

W-There's no way you can get back into the lab to get it?

M-No. And I have a psychology text tomorrow morning. And I really need the book to study.

W-So, what're you gonna do?

M-Well, I could just study from my notes tonight, then go the the science building and get my book early tomorrow morning. The lab open at six A.M., and my test's at eight.

W-Six A.M.'s pretty early.

M-Yeah. I mean, I could do it. But I'd have to get up at, like, five o'clock, and I wouldn't have much time to study the stuff in the book before the test.

W-Hmmm...

M-My other option would be to study with another student from that class.

W-Do you know someone you can study with?

M-Yeah, there's a guy who sits next to me in class, and he actually asked me if I'd be interested in studying for the exam with him tonight.

W-And he has the book?

M-Yeah.

W-Well, why not do that? Then you'd have more time to study the stuff in the book.

M-Well, he's not a very good student. He's missed a lot of classes and he doesn't take good notes during the lectures.

W-So you might spend a lot of time tutoring him instead of studying the stuff you need to study.

M-Exactly. But he does have the book.



## TPO 39

- Some time: tomorrow
- Time conflict: thing on myself, thing on you
  1. prepare the audition: less friendly
  2. help a friend study: lack of preparation

W-How's it going, Tom?

M-So-so. I've got a problem.

W-What's up?

M-Well, the theater club's going to be doing this play I really wanna try out for, a production of Hamlet. It's my **favorite** Shakespeare play.

W-OK.

M-And I thought the auditions were next week, but it turns out they're tomorrow morning. So I haven't prepared at all.

W-Prepared what?

M-Well, to audition, you have to perform a monologue—you choose a small part of the play—like two or three minutes—and you perform it for the director. And based on that, the director chooses which actors will get parts in the play.

W-Oh, OK. But you still have tonight to prepare.

M-Well, the trouble is, I **promised** a friend I'd help him study for a **big** physics test tonight. He's not doing well in the class, and I got an A in that class last semester.

W-OK.

M-I mean I could just cancel, you know, just tell him "sorry, I can't help you tonight."

W-Could he find someone else to study with?

M-Yeah, he probably could. But I did promise him.

W-Hmmm.

M-Another option would be, I could help my friend study for his exam, and then after we finish, I could just stay up late—all night, if necessary—and prepare for the audition.

W-That'd still leave you enough time to prepare?

M-Yes, I think so. I mean, it'd definitely be better to have more time, but...

W-And you might not perform very well if you're tired.

M-Yeah. Hmmm.

> **In the conversation**, the man is facing a **time conflict**. He want to prepare for  the audition of his favorite Shakespeare play tonight since it's tomorrow, however, he has promised his friend to help him study for a big physics test at the same time. **He cannot do both**.
>
> The man first **indicated** that he should go to prepare for the audition, by canceling the plan with his friend; he also **proposed** that he can prepare late tonight after helping his friend study.
>
> **I'd suggest that** he **should** cancel the plan with his friend **for the best**, on account of the following reasons. **For one thing**, his friend is not taking the test tomorrow, so he still have time to help him study; **for another thing**, it's his favorite play and chance are that he will never be able to try it out if he didn't prepare for the audition tonight.



## TPO 40

- Some time: tonight
- Time conflict: study and play
  1. study only: lack of money
  2. go watch the play: lack of preparation of the test

M-Hey, Sally. How are you doing?

W-Well, OK, but I've got a bit of a problem.

M-Oh, year? What's up?

W-Well, I forgot that tonight is the night, um, my theater class is taking a trip, to see a play. We're taking a bus into the city.

M-Sounds like fun.

W-Yeah, well, we have to write a paper about the play for class. Cool thing is, my professor got free tickets for us. He and the director of the play are friends. So the whole class is going for free.

M-Free theater tickets, excellent. Theater tickets can be expensive.

W-Yeah. Problem is though I have a big history test tomorrow morning, and I really need to study. I've been putting it off, and I kinda forgot that tonight was when the theater class would be going to the play.

M-So you were planning to use tonight to study?

W-Yeah.

M-Well, could you do your studying, you know, study for the history test when you get back from the play tonight?

W-Yeah, it'd be late though. I could study some on the bus and stay up late when we get back from the play.

M-Not exactly ideal study conditions though.

W-Exactly. So I was thinking I could go by myself into the city another night to see the play. The paper we have to write on the play isn't due for a couple days, so there'd still be time.

M-Then you could get a good night's sleep before the history test.

W-Yep. But I'd have to buy the theater ticket myself. It's only free if I go with the class tonight.



## TPO 41

- Summer break
- Lack of: housing to stay
  1. stay with friends: lack of concord, with roommates
  2. stay in the dorm: lack of money

M-Hi, Kate. How's it going?

W-Pretty good. I just found out I'm going to be staying on campus during the semester break. Professor Clark asked me to help him with some research.

M-That's pretty big deal.

W-Yeah, I guess it is. But the problem is, the dorm's always close, so I need to find housing for about two weeks.

M-Oh, that's rough, but, didn't you mention that you had a couple of friends that live in an apartment not too far from campus? Are they gonna be around?

W-Yeah, Mary and Ellen. They say they're gonna stick around here during the break.

M-Well, so why don't you just stay with them?

W-I've been thinking about asking them.

M-And they probably wouldn't charge you anything, right? Just for couple of weeks.

W-Yeah, probably not. I'm sure they'd be fine with it, but since it's between classes and they won't have classes and stuff, I'm worried that...

M-You're afraid they might want to party too much?

W-Right. They'll be on vacation but I'll have to get up early in the morning to work all day, so, we'll be on completely different schedules.

M-Hmmm, well, another possibility is that sometimes you can get special permission to stay at a dorm.

W-Really? You mean they'd let me stay in my own dorm room? I wouldn't have to move?

M-Well, you would, actually, because they usually only keep one of the dorms open, and it's not the one you're in.

W-Hmmm, I wonder how much they charge.

M-Well, it's not as cheap as staying with friends but...

W-but it'd be quieter.

M-True.



## TPO 42

- Final week
- Lack of: original historical documents
  1. change topic: less efficiency
  2. wait: time conflict with final week

M-Hey Jill, what's on your mind?

W-I'm trying to decide what to do about the paper from my history class. A big part of the assignment is working with original historical documents.

M-Originals?

W-Yeah. You know, out libraries has all kinds of records and books dating back hundreds of years.

M-Amazing. So, is there a problem?

W-Uh-huh. The librarian just told me that the documents I was planning to use aren't available right now. They're old newspapers and they were in pretty bad shape, so the library sent them out for repairs, like, restoration work.

M-So you can't use them?

W-No. They say they won't be available for at least another two weeks. So I can't work on my paper.

M-Well, can you change what you are writing about? You know, choose a topic that doesn't involve those documents?

W-I could. There're plenty of historical topics, then I could really get working on the paper right away, but...

M-But what?

W-Well, I've already done a bunch of research on my current topic. I've collected a lot of information and I wouldn't be able to use any of it if I changed my topic.

M-Well, when did you say the documents, the old newspapers, will be available?

W-The librarian said two weeks.

M-So you could just postpone working on the paper, and wait until they're available.

W-Possibly. Unfortunately, that would mean doing major work on my paper in the last week of the school term, when I will be working on a lot of other thing. If I change the topic, I can really work on the paper right away.



## TPO 43

- Some time: next month
- Lack of: photo to publish
  1. less selective: less reputation
  2. less frequently: lack of concord with the name of the magazine

N-Listen to a conversation between the two student editors of a photography magazine called Campus Photo Monthly.

M-We are in trouble, Barbara. I don't think we can put together next month's issue. There just aren't enough good photos?

W-It's getting harder and harder to put together an issue.

M-Yeah, and this month is the worst ever. I don't get it. I mean, students are submitting lots of photographs, but, I think we've only got fifteen that are worth publishing. We can't print the magazine with only fifteen photographs.

W-Well, maybe we're being too selective? What if we use photos that maybe aren't great, but...

M-But that aren't horrible?

W-Right. I mean, some of these photographs we get from beginning photographers may not be the best, but if we lowered our standard a bit, we'd have a lot of more photos to publish.

M-Sure, but we'd have to be careful. We don't want to get a reputation for publishing low quality work.

W-Well, maybe. You know, we're just publishing too frequently. What if we stopped publishing every month, and instead, you know, if we just published every two months. We'd have a lot more submissions to choose from so we can pick and choose and still publish the good ones.

M-I guess. But people on campus sort of expect us to publish every month. I mean we are Campus Photo Monthly, aren't we?



## TPO 44

- N/A
- lack of: concord with roommate
  1. change my schedule: lack of efficiency
  2. change my place, library: lack of convenience

M-Hey, didn't you get a new roommate recently? Linda's her name, right? How's that working out?

W-Oh, Linda is nice. But, well, there's sort of a problem.

M-Oh?

W-Yeah, our schedules totally conflict. I like to do my studying late at night in our room, but she likes to sleep early. So unfortunately, my studying, my typing on the computer is keeping her awake.

M-What are you gonna do?

W-Well, we've talked about it. Linda has to get up early every morning for class, so there's nothing she can do. So as I see it, I've got two options.

M-What are they?

W-Well, I could just adjust my schedule. Start going to bed earlier and doing my studying either in the morning, or sometimes during the day the way Linda does.

M-So you'd change your daily schedule so it's more like your roommates?

W-Yeah, that way I couldn't be keeping her up at night.

M-Sure.

W-The thing is, I am not really a "morning person" when it comes to studying. So I am not sure how much work I'd get done in the morning, or at other times of the day, since I tend to be busy then doing other things.

M-What's your other option?

W-Well, I could go to the library at night.

M-Why not do that? Use the library?

W-Well, the thing is, I prefer the convenience of my own room. The library is OK, but, you know, I've got a really comfortable desk chair in my room and all my other stuffs there too, my books, my notes, the stuff I really need to help me study.



## TPO 45

- Some time: two days later
- Lack of: beautiful sunny day
  1. rewrite the scene: worse performance
  2. wait: lack of editing time

M-Hey, Sarah, how's it going?

W-Not great. It's the student film I've been directing, you know, that project I've been working on for my film class.

M-Right, you said you were directing a film. So what's wrong?

W-Well, the project's due in two days. We are supposed to film the final scene today, but it's raining. The scene is supposed to be set outside, with two characters talking in the park, on a beautiful sunny day.

M-Oh, no. I could rewrite the scene, I guess. I could revise it so it takes place inside a building instead. Maybe here in the student center somewhere? I could, but I'm happy with the scene as it's written now. The film has an optimistic, happy ending. That's why I wanted the last scene of the movie to be outside, on a bright sunny day, because it sets a positive mood.

M-Oh, I see. Well, the weather's supposed to be better tomorrow, sunny and warm. Why don't you film that scene tomorrow instead?

W-Thought of that, too. But since the project's due the day after tomorrow, I was planning on using tomorrow to review the film and do any final editing and, you know, all the last-minute details.

M-That's true. There wouldn't be much time for that.

W-Yeah, filming tomorrow might mean turning in a project to my professor that's not as polished, not as good as I'd like it to be.



## TPO 46

- Tomorrow
- Time conflict: study and family
  1. let friends help: less effective
  2. dinner with cousin: lack of film and discussion

W-Hey Bob, Been meaning to ask, how's that film class going?

M-Great, and guess what? There'a special class meeting tomorrow night to view an Alfred Hitchcock film, there'll be discussion after the film.

W-Hitchcock films are great. You're gonna be there right?

M-I don't know. There's a conflict.

W-What's that?

M-Well, I'm supposed to have dinner at the dinning hall with my cousin. He's coming tomorrow to spend the day in campus and check out the university, trying to decide whether to enroll in classes here next year.

W-Well, maybe I can help. I eat at the dinning hall every night, so if you want, he can come to dinner with me, and some friends of mine.

M-Hmm, that's really nice of you. It would help him if he got to talk to a few different people about campus life.

W-OK, let's do that.

M-Well, the thing is, he's kinda shy and he might be uncomfortable with people he doesn't know, and I do want him to enjoy himself here.

W-Hey, we'll be nice. Anyway, do you have a better idea?

M-Well, I can skip the film and have dinner with my cousin as planned. I'd rent the film and watch it later.

W-But what about the discussion?

M-I'd miss that. And it could be very interesting.

W-Well, let me know when you decide.



## TPO 47

- Next week
- Lack of: space for a huge painting
  1. old painting: lack of technique
  2. new painting: lack of time

M-How's it going, Julie?

W-Not too good. You know the student art exhibit next week?

M-No, what's that?

W-It's where a few art students are chosen to show a piece of artwork in the student center for people to see.

M-Oh, cool, you were chosen?

W-Yeah, except I just found that I can't use the painting I did for it.

M-Why not?

W-Because it's too big. I'm into working on a really large scale now. And the painting I did for the show is huge. It's like a three-meter-wide canvas. But each artist only gets a small amount of wall space.

M-The organizers can't make an exception?

W-No, they say it wouldn't be fair to the other students if they let me have more space.

M-That's too bad. What are you gonna do?

W-I don't know. I could give them an older painting. I do have one that's small enough.

M-Great.

W-Yeah, it's a nice painting and all, it's just I did it a while ago. My technique has improved a lot since then, so it wouldn't be my best work or anything. I don't think it's as good as what I am doing now.

M-Well, could you maybe do a new painting, a smaller one, by next week, for the show?

W-Yeah, I could, then it would be more fresh, something I'd be more proud of. But I'm really busy right now. I've got some exams coming up that I really need to study for it.



## TPO 48

- Summer break
- Lack of: lab report to submit
  1. stay and rewrite: lack of family reunion
  2. rewrite in summer: lack of study material

M-Hey Cindy, you look happy, making plans for the summer vacation?

W-I'm just glad this semester is finally over. I just finished my final exams so I'm taking off for summer vacation tomorrow, aren't you?

M-I wish.

W-What do you mean?

M-I have to rewrite the lab report for my biology class. I guess I did it all wrong so the professor is making me rewrite it before he'll submit the final grade.

W-I guess that's better than if he just give you a bad grade on it, right?

M-I guess so, but I was planning on leaving town tomorrow too. Now I'm not sure I can. I spoke with the professor and he gave me two options. I can either turn in the revised report in one week and get my grade, or he said, I can wait, you know. Take an incomplete in the class, and submit the paper the next semester in the fall.

W-So are you gonna stay around to revise your report?

M-I could. I'd get the grade for the class on time and I wouldn't have to think about it any more. But there's a family reunion this weekend. I was really looking forward to it. If I stay around to revise the report, I'll miss the reunion.

W-Well, maybe you should take your time and work on the report over the summer. You can submit it when you return in the fall semester and get your grade then.

M-That'd be fine. But what if I need materials from the library to revise the report. I don't know if I'd be able to find the materials at the library at home.

W-Hmm...



## TPO 49

- Summer break
- Lack of: online Russian course
  1. on-campus Russian course: lack of time with sister
  2. online Spanish course: lack of interests

M-Hey Lisa, how are you? Any big plans for the summer break?

W-Well, I thought I knew what my plans were. But now I'm not sure.

M-How come?

W-Well, you know how we're required to take a foreign language course before we graduate?

M-Yeah?

W-I want to take it this summer, since I'm graduating next year, and I'll have a busy course schedule. So I signed up to take a Russian course online over the summer because I am hoping to take a trip to Russia at some point.

M-Online? That's cool! You wouldn't have to stay around campus and you could do it from home.

W-Exactly, you do everything over the Internet. But not enough people signed up for the class, so they canceled it. Now I don't what to do. I still need to fulfill the requirement.

M-Well, could you take a Russian class on campus this summer, instead of the online course?

W-Yeah, there's a regular Russian class being offered on campus. And it has space, so I could sign up, and just stay in the dorms this summer and live on campus.

M-OK.

W-I was looking forward to being home this summer, though, and spending some time with my family. My sister is coming back from China, she's been working there for a year and I haven't seen her.

M-Oh, that's disappointing.

W-I checked though, and I could take a different language course online. There's one being offered in Spanish.

M-Great, so why don't you just do that? You'd be able to spend time with your sister

W-Yeah, but I'm that excited about taking Spanish. I thought it would be fun to learn some Russian, it's more interesting to me. Though at least this way I could get the requirement out of the way, so I don't know.



## TPO 50

- N/A
- Time conflict: study and work
  1. less frequent: lack of satisfaction
  2. lower-level class: lack of interests

W-So how's the semester going so far?

M-Well, I'm having some trouble. I need some advice.

W-OK.

M-Well, I'm taking advanced chemistry and it's turning out to be a lot more work than I expected, especially because we have to put in so much time in the laboratory.

W-OK.

M-Yeah, I really like it, but my schedule is just too full because, you know, I'm also writing a weekly editorial for the campus newspaper? And now with advanced chemistry, it's too much.

W-That's right. Yes, I enjoy reading your editorials. Well, uh, how about instead of writing an editorial every week, you only write one every two weeks? Then next semester you go back to writing it every week.

M-Hmm, it is hard to keep up with those weekly deadlines. And that would give me the extra time I need for advanced chemistry. But, my editorial has a lot of readers. It's the first thing I lot of people read, and I hate to disappoint them.

W-OK. Well, there's another possibilities. You'll require to take a science course, but you don't have to take an advanced course. So you could switch to a less challenging course, basic chemistry.

M-I guess the basic course would take up less time.

W-Definitely, for one thing, you'll spend much less time in the laboratory.

M-Hmm, that's an interesting idea. But I love the challenge of the advanced course. I feel like I'm learning so much.
