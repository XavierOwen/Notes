## Structure

- the title of this section varies in different disciplines/journals
- most journals publish a Guide for Authors
- explain what I did and how I did it
- make sure my readers can replicate and obtain similar results, and also accept

## Grammar and Writing Skills

- passive and tense pairs
- use of 'a' and 'the'
- adverbs and adverb location

### Passives and tense pairs

- PhD thesis usually is written in the passive
- if the procedure is normally done or standard, I can use the present simple tense
- To specifically indicate what I did, I should use the past simple tense, and adding phrases like *in this study* to distinguish my work from others that I cited before.

### Use of 'a' and  'the'

What's the rule of the use of 'a' and 'the'?

- singular countable nouns need a determiner, like *the*, *my*, *some*, *one*.
- the way I use a noun can determine whether it is countable or uncountable.
- use *the* if or when I and my reader both know which thing/person I mean, and *a* otherwise.
- use *the* if there is only one possible referent
- use *a* if it doesn't matter or I don't know or my reader doesn't know which thing/person I am referring to

### Adverbs and adverb location

- be careful when using many adverbs in a sentence.
- solution 1: change the location of the adverb
- solution 2: break the sentence down into units, each with its own adverb.

Example

- He gave a lecture about liver cancer at the hospital last January
- Last January, he gave a lecture about liver cancer at the hospital
- Last January, he gave a lecture at the hospital; his subject was liver cancer

## Writing Task

Here is an example article. It's title is *Changes in the chemistry of groundwater in the chalk of the London Basin* and below is its methodology section. What is the purpose of each sentences?

|Sentence Number|Sentence|Purpose|Note|
|:-:|:-|:-|:-|
|1.1|The current investigation involved sampling and analyzing six sites to measure changes in groundwater chemistry.|to offer a general overview of the entire subsection, including the purpose of the investigation|It's important to put a general introduction at the beginning of this section. There are three common way to briefly introduce my methodology. First, I can outline the parameters of the work. This includes the number of tests, the equipment/material/software used, etc. Second, I can provide background information about the materials or about the source of the materials/equipment. Third, I can refer back to something in the introduction. Options include restating the aim of the project, or the problem I am hoping to solve.|
|1.2|The sites were selected from the London Basin area, which is located in the south-east of England and has been frequently used to interpret groundwater evolution.<sup>2,3,4</sup>|to provide background information and justifies the choice of location by referring to previous research|Make sure to include exactly what I did/used, and also the reasons for those decisions. For the background information, the present simple tense can be used.|
|2.3|A total of 18 samples was collected and then analyzed for the isotopes mentioned earlier.|to provide an overview of the procedure/method itself|A general overview if common to lead a new paragraph and it helps to create a general framework before the details.|
|2.4|Samples 1-9 were collected in thoroughly-rinsed 25 ml brown glass bottles which were filled to the top and then sealed tightly to prevent contamination. |to provide details about what was done and used, and also show that care was taken|It's better to give slightly too much information than too little. The details I am familiar with might not be familiar to my readers and they can be important to the research. Also, there is often a space between the quantity and the SI symbol.|
|2.5|The filled bottles were shipped directly to two separate laboratories at Reading University, where they were analyzed using standard methods suitably miniaturized to handle small quantities of water.<sup>5</sup>|to continue to describe what was done in detail, using language which communicates that care was taken|I should also add certain adjectives, adverbs to convince my readers that the methodology is carried out accurately and with care.|
|3.6|Samples 10-18 were prepared in our laboratory using a revised version of the precipitation method established by ISF Institute in Germany.<sup>6</sup> |to describe what was done by referring to existing methods in the literature|Use the present simple for background/reference, and the past simple when describing what I did. And to do comparisons, it's common to keep previous and current research procedure clearly so that my readers can see the difference.|
|3.7|This method obtains a precipitate through the addition of BaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O; the resulting precipitate can be washed and stored easily.|to provide more detailed information about the method and show it to have been a good choice|This sentence aims to answer possible criticisms/doubts about my choices, by giving enough reasons.|
|3.8|The samples were subsequently shipped to ISF for analysis by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). |to provide more details of the method|Some additional details.|
|3.9|All tubing used was stainless steel, and although two samples were at risk of CFC contamination as a result of brief contact with plastic, variation among samples was negligible.|to put up a possible difficulty in the methodology|I can say that this problem in the methodology didn't affect the results. Or if this difficulty caused an improvement in the methodology. And remember you can discuss it in a more positive attitude and suggest a solution.|
