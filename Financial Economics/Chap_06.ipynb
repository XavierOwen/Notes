    "\n",
    "It's also a terrible thing in the original expression that the utility from consumption in period $1$ may be dependent on the consumption in period $0$. Or mathematically, $\\ffrac{\\partial^2 u\\P{c_0,c_{1\\omega}}} {\\partial c_0 \\partial c_{1\\omega}} \\neq0$. Well, that's not what we want. So we now assume that\n",

    "\n",
    "And we're not gonna stop here. Further, we let $u\\P{c_0,c_1} = u_0\\P{c_0} + u_1\\P{c_1}$, the ***time addictive*** (or ***time separable***) utility function. This is to say that:\n",

    "The next thing to point out is that one key feature from $U$ that is also different from $u$, the ***Ordinailty序数性*** where $u$ is with ***Cardinality基数性***: if we apply a *positive monotonical* (*not linear*) function on $U$, the relative order of **consumption plans** will remain the same and $u$, doesn't have that property.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when comparing the different consumption palns, the relative number of $u$ is important. While with the form of $U$, the preference of an agent can be expressed by $u$ solely, or a positive linear transform of $u$."
