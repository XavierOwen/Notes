Notes on courses and seminars I've taken, welcome.

- Actuarial Mathematics
- Applied Random Process
- Econometrics
- Financial Economics
- Fundamental Business Statistics
- Intermediate Investment
- Introduction to Numerical Computing

The notes are originally taken in iPython Notebook. Convert them to `.md` using command

```
jupyter nbconvert --to markdown notebook_name.ipynb
```

/*I'll try to avoid using macros in the future*/

The `.css` file in the `others` folder is the one I'm currently using, feel free to try

Update, 181022

Just found that using Macro is possible in `.md` actually, little adjustment required thought. My goal is now to have them all perfectly rendered in Typora.

My custom theme file is [github_custom.css](https://github.com/XavierOwen/Notes/tree/master/others/github_custom.css); you can download and copy to your Typora theme folder.

:heart: [Typora](https://typora.io/)
