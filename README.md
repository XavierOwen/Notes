Using MathJax Macros are banned in `.md`  file, so the notes are originally taken in iPython Notebook. Convert them using command

```
jupyter nbconvert --to markdown notebook_name.ipynb
```

I'll try to avoid using macros in the future

The `.css` file in the `others` folder is the one I'm currently using, feel free to try

Update, 181022

Just found that using Macro is possible in `.md` actually, little adjustment required thought. My goal is now to have them all perfectly rendered in Typora.

:heart: Typora
