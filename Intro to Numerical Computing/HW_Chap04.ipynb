    "So in part 2, there're four plots and the error can be seen with $n = 15, 20$. So with the degree of the polynomial going up, the root-finding by MATLAB is getting more and more incorrect. There're shouldn't be any complex number but seen from the figure, there \"is\" after $n$ gets larger like $15$ or more. And we can also find that at $n = 20$, even the real part of the root is incorrect because the real root is only integer from $1$ to $20$, but there's a $21$ in the axis. So another conclusion maybe that larger $n$ leads to a worse result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in part 3, we estimate the condition number of this root-finding. It keeps going up with increasing $n$, from $10^{-1}$ to $10^{10}$. So it's getting more and more ill-conditioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "And besides I also tried to make a experiment with larger $n$ like $100$, and I find that the conditional number will not increase anymore, so it seems that its upper limit is $10^{10}$. Can't figure out why.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Explanation$\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative error in the output are about $1$, and the relative error in the input is about the inverse of pertubation, which is in the order of $10^{10}$. And that's way the condition number will not going up even the n gets bigger."
