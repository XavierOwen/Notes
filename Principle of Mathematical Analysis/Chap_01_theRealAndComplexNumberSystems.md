# The Real and Complex Number Systems

## Intro

We need ï»¿an accurately defined number concept. **Rational number** system is *inadequate*, not a field, not an ordered set.

> There's no rational $p$ such that $p^2=2$.

Thus we have **irrational numbers**.

- often written as infinite decimal expansions
- considered to be "approximated" by the corresponding finite decimals

**e.g.**

> Show equation $p^2=2$ is not satisfied by any rational $p$.
