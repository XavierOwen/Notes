\begin{myleftlinebox}
	area between curves
	\tcblower
	The area between curves $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ and between $x=a$ and $x=b$ is 
	\[A=\int_a^b \abs{f(x)-g(x)}\dif x\]
	Similarly we have the area between curves $h(y)$ and $l(y)$ and between $y=c$ and $y=d$ is
	\[A = \int_c^d \abs{h(y)-l(y)}\dif y\]
\end{myleftlinebox}

\subsection{Exercises}

	Find the area of the triangle enclosed by $y=x$, $y=2x$ and $y=2-x$ using integration, both on $x$ axis and on $y$ axis.
